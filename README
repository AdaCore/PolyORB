This is the documentation for AdaBroker version @adabroker_version@.

Build requirements
------------------

Ada 95 compiler: GNAT 3.13p, 3.13a or 3.13a1.

Build instructions
------------------

See file INSTALL.

Usage
-----

  idlac [-i] [-k] idl_file [-cppargs ...]

  -i    Generate implementation template.
  -k    Keep temporary files.
  -q    Be quiet.
  -cppargs ARGS
        Pass ARGS to the C++ preprocessor.

This creates several files :

- myinterface.ads, myinterface.adb : these files contain the mapping
  for user defined types (client and server side).

- myinterface-impl.ads, myinterface-impl.adb : these files are to be
  filled by the user. They contain the implementation of the
  server. They are generated only if the -i flag is specified.

- myinterface.ads, myinterface.adb : these files
  contain the client stubs for the interface.

- myinterface-skel.ads, myinterface-skel.adb : these files
  contain the server-side skeletons for the interface.

- myinterface-stream.ads, myinterface-stream.adb : these files
  contain subprograms to marshall data according to the CDR protocol.


Features
--------

- Most of the CORBA features are implemented except dynamic
  invocation. This includes CORBA types, CORBA exceptions, forward
  declarations and multiple inheritance. The Ada tasking is also
  working with AdaBroker. The 'examples' subdirectory provides
  several examples of the available features.

- This release has been succesfully tested on:

    - Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 (Potato) on Intel and Sparc
    - FreeBSD 4.0 and 5.0-CURRENT (with GNAT 3.13a1)
    - HP/UX 10.20 (client without tasking)
    - Solaris 2.5.1, 2.6 and 2.7 on Sparc

- The following interoperability configurations have been reported
  to work, at least to some extent:

  AdaBroker client, MICO server
  AdaBroker client, omniORB server
  AdaBroker client, ORBit server
  AdaBroker client, TAO server

  AdaBroker server, omniORB client
  AdaBroker server, ORBit client
  AdaBroker server, TAO client

  If you are in any other situation, please let us know what works
  and what does not. Do not hesitate to report any problem that you
  encounter (see section "Bug reports" below.)

- If you need to debug AdaBroker, you can create a file broca.opt in
  your current directory. This file should contain lines with package
  names you want to debug. For instance, corba.orb will enable debug
  messages from package CORBA.ORB. If you want to debug C++ files, you
  can set the environment variable TRACELEVEL to a given naturel depending
  on how much detailed you want the output to be.


Bug reports
-----------

If you find a bug and would like to submit fixes, please do so
indicating what release you use. We accept patch files. To produce
such a patch file, put your files in the AdaBroker directory and our
files in the directory AdaBroker.orig, and use the following command:

  diff --recursive --context adabroker.orig adabroker > patch_file

and send us the patch_file via e-mail at the address 

          adabroker-bugs@adabroker.eu.org

If your diff version do not understand the --recursive or --context
option, please use the GNU diffutils package which may be found on any
GNU archive (e.g. ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/gnu/).

Note that unified diff files (-u option of GNU diff) are also welcomed.
