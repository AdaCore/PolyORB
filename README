This is the README file for PolyORB version @polyorb_version@.

The home page of the project is located at http://libre.adacore.com/polyorb/
This is where you can find news about the project, new releases, and
pointers to several documents and papers related to PolyORB.

What is PolyORB?
----------------

PolyORB is a polymorphic, reusable infrastructure for building
object-oriented distributed systems.  Middleware environments are
software libraries that hide the complex issues of distribution
and provide the programmer with high-level abstractions that allow
easy and transparent construction of distributed applications.
A number of different standards exist for creating object-oriented
distributed applications.  These standards define two things:

    * the interface seen by the developer's applicative objects;
    * the protocol used by the middleware environment to talk to other
      nodes in the distributed application.

Usually, middleware for one platform supports only one set of
such interfaces, and cannot interoperate with other platforms.

A polymorphic middleware allows the existence of several different
implementations of each of these aspects to be used within the same
middleware framework.  In addition, PolyORB allows such different
personalities to coexist in the same instance of the running middleware;
it decouples the personality presented to applications on one side
("application personality"), and the personality presented
to other middleware on the other side ("protocol personality").
Multiple implementations of each personalisable aspect can
coexist within the same instance of the running middleware:
unlike previous generic middleware, PolyORB is actually schizophrenic.

The decoupling of application and protocol personalities, and the support
for multiple simultaneous personalities within the same running middleware
are key features required for the construction of interoperable
distributed applications.  This allows PolyORB to communicate
with middleware that implement different distribution standards:
PolyORB provides middleware-to-middleware interoperability.

The PolyORB architecture also permits the automatic,
just-in-time creation of proxies between incompatible environments
(although this feature is not implemented yet).

PolyORB can be used in Ada 95 and Ada 2005 applications alike. It is
implemented in Ada 2005 and C.

See the PolyORB User's Guide for more details on PolyORB usage.

Bug reports
-----------

If you find a bug or would like to submit patches, please do so indicating
the release you use. We accept patch files. To produce such a patch file,
put your files in the PolyORB directory and our files in the directory
PolyORB.orig, and use the following command:

  diff --recursive --context PolyORB.orig PolyORB > patch_file

If your diff version do not understand the --recursive or --context
option, please use the GNU diffutils package which may be found on any
GNU archive (e.g. ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/gnu/).

Note that unified diff files (-u option of GNU diff) are also welcomed.

Unsupported users may directly send their patches and bug report via
e-mail at the address
   polyorb-bugs@lists.adacore.com

or seek community support through the public mailing list:
   polyorb-users@lists.adacore.com

Please use the Problem Report Form in docs/PROBLEM-REPORT-FORM.
Please include the complete output of "polyorb-config --version"
in any problem report.

If you are interested in becoming a supported PolyORB user, you should
send an email to sales@adacore.com.

Mailing-lists
-------------

The mailing-list PolyORB-Users serves as a informal forum for
technical discussions about PolyORB among users.
