Installation :
--------------

- create a symbolic link in AdaBroker, pointing to omniORB_2.7.1 (if
  you use another version of omniORB, update the config.mk file in
  AdaBroker/config)

- add AdaBroker/bin to your PATH

- run make in AdaBroker directory. It will compile the AdaBroker
  libraries, omniidl2 with the ada backend (and the C++ backend), and
  the examples.

Usage :
-------

   omniidl2 -bada [ -i ] myinterface.idl creates several files :

- myinterface.ads, myinterface.adb : these files contain the mapping
  for user defined types (client and server side).

- myinterface-impl.ads, myinterface-impl.adb : these files are to be
  filled by the user. They contain the implementation of the
  server. They are generated only if the -i flag is specified.

- myinterface-proxies.ads, myinterface-proxies.adb : these files
  contain utilities to make proxy calls.

- myinterface-skeleton.ads, myinterface-skeleton.adb : these files
  contain utilities for the server-side implementation.

- myinterface-marshal.ads, marshal-marshal.adb : they contain
  subprograms to marshall types according to the GIOP protocol.

Bug reports:
------------

If you find a bug and would like to submit fixes, please do so
indicating what release you use. We accept patch files. To produce
such a patch file, put your files in the AdaBroker directory and our
files in the directory AdaBroker.orig, and use the following command:

  diff --recursive --context AdaBroker.orig AdaBroker > patch_file

and send us the patch_file via E-mail at the address broker@inf.enst.fr.

If your diff version do not understand the --recursive or --context
option, please use the GNU diffutils package which may be found on any
GNU archive (e.g. ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/gnu/).

Note that unified diff files (-u option of GNU diff) are also welcomed.
