Installation :
--------------

- create a symbolic link in AdaBroker, pointing to omniORB_2.7.1 (if
  you use another version of omniORB, update the config.mk file in
  AdaBroker/config)

- run 'make export'. It will compile the AdaBroker libraries and
  adabroker executable. The installation procedure is similar to
  omniORB installation procedure. For instance, adabroker executable
  is installed in omniORB_2.7.1/bin/<platform>. Same thing for
  libraries and ali files (installed in omniORB_2.7.1/lib/<platform>.

- go to AdaBroker/Examples and run 'make' to build examples.

- note that AdaBroker works with EGCS only.

Usage :
-------

  adabroker [ -i ] myinterface.idl creates several files :

- myinterface.ads, myinterface.adb : these files contain the mapping
  for user defined types (client and server side).

- myinterface-impl.ads, myinterface-impl.adb : these files are to be
  filled by the user. They contain the implementation of the
  server. They are generated only if the -i flag is specified.

- myinterface-proxy.ads, myinterface-proxy.adb : these files
  contain utilities to make proxy calls.

- myinterface-skel.ads, myinterface-skel.adb : these files
  contain utilities for the server-side implementation.

- myinterface-stream.ads, myinterface-stream.adb : they contain
  subprograms to marshall types according to the GIOP protocol.

Bug reports:
------------

If you find a bug and would like to submit fixes, please do so
indicating what release you use. We accept patch files. To produce
such a patch file, put your files in the AdaBroker directory and our
files in the directory AdaBroker.orig, and use the following command:

  diff --recursive --context AdaBroker.orig AdaBroker > patch_file

and send us the patch_file via E-mail at the address 
adabroker-bugs@adabroker.eu.org

If your diff version do not understand the --recursive or --context
option, please use the GNU diffutils package which may be found on any
GNU archive (e.g. ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/gnu/).

Note that unified diff files (-u option of GNU diff) are also welcomed.
