========================================================

Copyright (c) 2008, AdaCore

This file contains a complete list of new features in version 2.4 of PolyORB.
See also file NEWS for various information about this release.

An ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) appears in parentheses after the description line.
This date shows the implementation date of the feature. Any 2.4w wavefront
subsequent to this date will contain the indicated feature, as will any
subsequent releases.

NF-24-H311-027 No default MIOP access point address (2008-03-17)

  The MIOP (Unreliable Multicast Inter-ORB Protocol) access point does not
  listen on a default group address anymore. Run-time configuration parameters
  polyorb.miop.multicast_addr and polyorb.miop.multicast_port in section
  [miop] must now be set explicitly to enable the MIOP access point.

NF-24-H226-012 Gnatdist displays executed commands (2008-02-25)

  When not in quiet mode, gnatdist now prints all commands it executes on
  standard error, just as gnatmake.

NF-24-H214-018 po_gnatdist does not depend on polyorb-config (2008-02-21)

  The PolyORB/DSA partitioning tool, po_gnatdist, does not depend on the
  external shell script polyorb-config to locate the PolyORB runtime library
  anymore. This allows po_gnatdist to be usable on platforms that do not
  provide a Bourne shell, such as MinGW.

NF-24-H110-025 Environment variables passing to slave partitions (2008-02-25)

  A list of environment variables can now be associated with partitions
  in gnatdist configuration files. When starting a distributed application
  using a generated launcher (shell or Ada), these variables are then passed
  from the main partition's environment to the slave partitions.

NF-24-H109-006 Conditional form of pragma Debug (2008-01-28)

  PolyORB sources now use the conditional (two-argument) form of pragma Debug,
  so that the debug message strings are constructed only if traces are
  enabled for the particular module. This significantly reduces the run-time
  performance cost of enabling pragma Debug. Users can thus decide to
  leave it enabled even in production systems, for more convenient debugging.

  As a result of making this the default, the supporting script
  support/enable-conditional-debug has been removed from the PolyORB
  distribution.

NF-24-H107-031 Hosts with multiple IP addresses (2008-01-11)

  When an object reference contains a host name corresponding to multiple
  IP addresses, connection attempts try successive addresses in turn if
  the connection fails, instead of bailing out after the first attempt.
