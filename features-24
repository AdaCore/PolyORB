This file contains a complete list of new features in version 2.4 of PolyORB.
See also file NEWS for various information about this release.

An ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) appears in parentheses after the description line.
This date shows the implementation date of the feature. Any 2.4w wavefront
subsequent to this date will contain the indicated feature, as will any
subsequent releases.

NF-24-H226-012 Gnatdist displays executed commands (2008-02-25)

  When not in quiet mode, gnatdist now prints all commands it executes on
  standard error, just as gnatmake.

NF-24-H110-025 Environment variables passing to slave partitions (2008-02-25)

  A list of environment variables can now be associated with partitions
  in gnatdist configuration files. When starting a distributed application
  using a generated launcher (shell or Ada), these variables are then passed
  from the main partition's environment to the slave partitions.

NF-24-H109-006 Conditional form of pragma Debug (2008-01-28)

  PolyORB sources now use the conditional (two-argument) form of pragma Debug,
  so that the debug message strings are constructed only if traces are
  enabled for the particular module. This significantly reduces the run-time
  performance cost of enabling pragma Debug. Users can thus decide to
  leave it enabled even in production systems, for more convenient debugging.

  As a result of making this the default, the supporting script
  support/enable-conditional-debug has been removed from the PolyORB
  distribution.

NF-24-H107-031 Hosts with multiple IP addresses (2008-01-11)

  When an object reference contains a host name corresponding to multiple
  IP addresses, connection attempts try successive addresses in turn if
  the connection fails, instead of bailing out after the first attempt.
