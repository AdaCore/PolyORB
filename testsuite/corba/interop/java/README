README for the PolyORB CORBA interoperability tests
---------------------------------------------------

$Id: //droopi/main/examples/corba/all_types/interop/java/README#4 $

* Compatibility

PolyORB has been (partially) successfully tested with
 - OpenORB 1.3.0
 - Jonathan 3.0 alpha 10

* Compilation

To compile these examples, you need to edit the makefile
Makefile.<your_ORB> to setup: 
- Java SDK and JRE; 
- Path to ORB jar files.

Currently, the sources only compile for Jonathan, compiling for
OpenORB requires little adaptation of implementation files.

* Run the tests

Type

make run_dynserver -f Makefile.<your_ORB> to run the DSI server;
make run_dynclient -f Makefile.<your_ORB> to run the DII client;

The object IOR is stored in the `IOR` file and read _from this file_
by clients.

* Compatibility note

- OpenORB: the IDL file has been modified to accomodate bug in
compilation process...

- Jonathan: the union Java code seems buggy.
