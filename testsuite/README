README for the PolyORB testsuite
--------------------------------

This file details the organization of PolyORB's test suite.

* Directory structure

acats/ : source for the Distributed System Annex test suite, from the
        ACATS suite,

corba/ : source for the CORBA test suite,

core/ : source for the PolyORB's core test suite,

scenarios/ : scenarios to be executed when running the test suite,

utils/ : tools used to run the test suite.

* Preparing PolyORB to run the test suite

1/ Build PolyORB

Refer to PolyORB User's Guide for more information.

We suppose you build PolyORB in $build_dir.

2/ Build PolyORB's examples

$ make examples

3/ Build the test suite

$ make testsuite

Note: some tests are not built by default: they require the
installation of third-party middleware, and adaptation of the
makefiles. See corba/interop/cpp/README and corba/interop/java/README
for more details.

* Run the test suite

Note: GNATPython is required to run the testsuite. To install it, run:
svn checkout svn://scm.forge.open-do.org/scmrepos/svn/gnatpython/trunk gnatpython
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/gnatpython

$ make run_tests

or

$ ./testsuite -j N --diff

All results are stored in the 'out' directory by default and log in the 'log'
directory.

To run only the corba tests:

./testsuite.py -j N --diff corba

To run the all_exceptions corba tests

./testsuite.py -j N --diff corba/all_exceptions/

And to run a specific test CORBA_ALL_EXCEPTIONS_0

./testsuite.py -j N --diff corba/all_exceptions/CORBA_ALL_EXCEPTIONS_0

A report is created in out/report.

See ./testsuite.py -h for more help
