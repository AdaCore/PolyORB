$Id: //droopi/main/testsuite/README#2 $

This file details the organization of PolyORB's test suite.

* Directory structure

acats/ : source for the Distributed System Annex test suite, from the
        ACATS suite,

corba/ : source for the CORBA test suite,

core/ : source for the PolyORB's core test suite,

scenarios/ : scenarios to be executed when running the test suite,

utils/ : tools used to run the test suite.

* Preparing PolyORB to run the test suite

1/ Build PolyORB

Refer to PolyORB User's Guide for more information.

We suppose you build PolyORB in $build_dir.

2/ Build PolyORB's examples

$ make examples

3/ Build the test suite

$ make testsuite

Note: some tests are not built by default: they require the
installation of third-party middleware, and adaptation of the
makefiles. See corba/interop/cpp/README and corba/interop/java/README
for more details.

* Run the test suite

$ make run_tests

This will launch the test suite. Output is in $build_dir/output.

$build_dir/output/error provides information on any internal error,
$build_dir/output/failed lists failed tests,
$build_dir/output/log provides various information,
$build_dir/output/<scenario_name>/<test> is a trace of the test.
