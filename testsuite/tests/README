PolyORB Testsuite
=================

You'll need to install GNATPython to run the testsuite.

Before running the testsuite, you need to run 'make testsuite' in polyorb
root directory.

To run the testsuite with N jobs in parallel and to show error messages,
run:

./testsuite.py -j N --diff

All results are stored in the 'out' directory by default and log in the 'log'
directory.

To run only the corba tests:

./testsuite.py -j N --diff corba

To run the all_exceptions corba tests

./testsuite.py -j N --diff corba/all_exceptions/

And to run a specific test CORBA_ALL_EXCEPTIONS_0

./testsuite.py -j N --diff corba/all_exceptions/CORBA_ALL_EXCEPTIONS_0

A report is created in out/report.

See ./testsuite.py -h for more help
