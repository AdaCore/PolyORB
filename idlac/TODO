These are some points to be implemented or improved in idlac :

	- the token T_ERROR is not taken into account in the parser. It creates parser errors while the error in only in the lexer.


	- the parsing of sequences is not completly done. Some tricky cases are not taken into account. The problem is the following code :
		const long r = 5;
		interface Bug {
			typedef sequence <sequence <long, 5 >> r >> s;
		}
the first ">>" is not well understood since it is difficult to know whether it is the name of the type (r could be overloaded) or the second operand of the >> operation. Some code is to be added in parse_sequence_type in idl_fe-parser.adb.


	- all_errors.idl is not complete.


	- the types Idl_Integer and Idl_Float should have an unlimited precision. It is not the case and moreover, there is no check on the length of the entry in the functions get_integer, get_float and get_fixed of idl_fe-parser.idl


	- in the value definitions, some special cases are not correctly handled :
		- you should not be able to overload an operation or an attribute
		- the support of interfaces is badly managed : clashes between attributes or operations are not detected
		- you should not be able to overload a factory or a member


	- I'm not sure that the ranges of the types float, double and long double are right. To be checked using paragraph 3.10.1.2 of the specification.


	- some useless cases in switch statement are potentially not detected (for example case 1, default : ...)


	- there is no verification that all the cases of a switch are distincts. There was some code written to handle a list of all values already used in a given switch statement. But this was never used. You can find this code after the lines :
   ---------------------------------
   --  Management of expressions  --
   ---------------------------------
in idl_fe-parser.adb and idl_fe-parser.ads.


	- some FIXMES were left in the code (5 at this moment). They explain the problem

	- the function Img for constant_value_ptr in utils.adb does only work for integers

	- merge torture and all_definitions examples.
