NF-25-H521-008 Debug_Policy is now enabled by default (2008-05-21)

  Configuration pragma Debug_Policy is now set to Check by default in all
  PolyORB builds, to allow the user to obtain debugging traces under control
  of the run-time configuration. Two new configure command line switches
  are provided (--enable-assertion-policy and --enable-debug-policy) which
  allow the user to override these two policies.
