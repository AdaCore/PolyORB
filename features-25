NF-25-H521-008 Debug_Policy is now enabled by default (2008-05-21)

  Configuration pragma Debug_Policy is now set to Check by default in all
  PolyORB builds, to allow the user to obtain debugging traces under control
  of the run-time configuration. Two new configure command line switches
  are provided (--enable-assertion-policy and --enable-debug-policy) which
  allow the user to override these two policies.

NF-25-G726-017 IAC is now the default IDL compiler (2008-05-08)

  IAC is the new default IDL compiler provided by PolyORB. Its command
  line interface is compatible with the legacy idlac compiler, making
  it suitable as a drop-in replacement. IAC also offers a number of
  new features, including optional generation of minimal perfect hash
  tables for skeletons, generation of static marshallers for faster
  handling of remote calls, and the ability to pretty-print IDL files.
  Detailed documentation of these new features can be found in the
  PolyORB User's Guide. Note that the legacy idlac compiler is still
  provided in the PolyORB source tree.
