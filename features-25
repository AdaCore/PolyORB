This file contains a complete list of new features in version 2.5 of PolyORB.
See also file NEWS for various information about this release.

An ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) appears in parentheses after the description line.
This date shows the implementation date of the feature. Any 2.5w wavefront
subsequent to this date will contain the indicated feature, as will any
subsequent releases.

NF-25-H704-004 Better detection of conflicting middleware setups (2008-07-09)

  Middleware setups that include more than one ORB tasking policy or more than
  one ORB controller are now detected at initialization time and cause an
  exception to be raised instead of silently proceeding with execution of the
  inconsistent partition.

NF-25-H624-006 New IAC command line switch -nocpp (2008-07-09)

  A new command line switch "-nocpp" is supported by IAC, indicating that
  the input file has already been preprocessed, and should not be preprocessed
  again.

NF-25-H616-002 IAC generates NOT NULL constraints in impl (2008-06-18)

  When generating implementation templates, the IDL to Ada compiler, IAC,
  now generates explicit NOT NULL constraints for the Self formal parameter
  of primitive operations. This allows the use subprogram renaming
  declarations as the bodies of such primitive operations when operating
  in Ada 2005 mode.

NF-25-H521-008 Debug_Policy is now enabled by default (2008-05-21)

  Configuration pragma Debug_Policy is now set to Check by default in all
  PolyORB builds, to allow the user to obtain debugging traces under control
  of the run-time configuration. Two new configure command line switches
  are provided (--enable-assertion-policy and --enable-debug-policy) which
  allow the user to override these two policies.

NF-25-G726-017 IAC is now the default IDL compiler (2008-05-08)

  IAC is the new default IDL compiler provided by PolyORB. Its command
  line interface is compatible with the legacy idlac compiler, making
  it suitable as a drop-in replacement. IAC also offers a number of
  new features, including optional generation of minimal perfect hash
  tables for skeletons, generation of static marshallers for faster
  handling of remote calls, and the ability to pretty-print IDL files.
  Detailed documentation of these new features can be found in the
  PolyORB User's Guide. Note that the legacy idlac compiler is still
  provided in the PolyORB source tree.
