INSTALL for Glade @glade_version@.
-----------------------

You can find general information about GLADE in README and in
Doc/user_guide.txt. Here are simple steps for building GLADE
easily. More details about installation and configuration can be found
in Doc/install_guide.txt.


1. Check your environment
   - verify that GNAT @gnat_version@ is installed and on your  path
   - verify that GLADE has been ported on your system (see README)
   - GLADE is usually build with GNU make. It may or may not be built 
     with other versions of make. If you have problems building GLADE
     with your local make tool, switch to GNU make.
   - verify that you will be able to run distributed applications
      (on Unix, your .rhost file must contain the machine from which
       you will start the distributed application)

2. Configure GLADE
   GLADE use standard the GNU configuration method. Run 
           ./configure  [configuration parameters]

   configuration parameters can be used to define the
   build/host/target machines, installation locations and other
   cutomizations (see Doc/install_guide.txt for details). By default,
   when no parameters are specified, the build machine is used as host
   and target and installation is done in /usr/local. It is advised to
   install GLADE first in a private directory for testing purposes.
   This can be achieved with the --prefix parameter, for instance:

      ./configure --prefix=$HOME/glade

3. Build & install GLADE
      this can be achieved simpy by doing 
         make install
      in the main GLADE directory. Be careful, you usually need root
      privileges to install software in /usr/local

4. Test your installation by running the Examples
   go in the Example directory and run simply 'make' then go in each 
   example directory and start the applications. Check the README in

5.  Example of complete build (assuming csh syntax):

% cd                             <--- go into your HOME directory
% gunzip glade-@glade_version@.tar.gz       <--- uncompress the distribution
% tar xf glade-@glade_version@.tar          <--- explode the distribution
% cd glade-@glade_version@                  <--- go into the distribution dir.
% ./configure --prefix=`pwd`     <--- configure the Makefiles using the current
                                      directory to install the binaries
% make install                   <--- compile files and install them
% set path=(`pwd`/bin $path)     <--- add this directory in your PATH
% cd Examples                    <--- go in the Example directory
% make                           <--- build all the examples
$ cd Eratho/absolute             <--- go in the first example directory
$ ./mainloop                     <--- run the distributed application
