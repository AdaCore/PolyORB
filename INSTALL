This file details the compilation and installation of PolyORB.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

PolyORB has been compiled and successfully tested on the following platforms:

- FreeBSD
- HP-UX
- Linux
- Solaris
- Windows

Build requirements
------------------

Ada 95 compiler:
  GNAT Pro 3.16a1 or later
  GNAT Pro 5.02a  or later
  GCC 3.4.0       or later

Optional: XmlAda (http://libre.act-europe.fr/xmlada/) if you want to
build the SOAP protocol personality.

Note: per construction, the macro 'configure' uses to find your GNAT
compiler looks first to the executables 'gnatgcc', then 'adagcc' and
finally to 'gcc' to find out which Ada compiler to use. You should be
very careful with your path and executables if you have multiple GNAT
versions installed. See below explanations on the ADA environment
variable if you need to override the default guess.

Build instructions
------------------

NOTE: Developers building PolyORB from the version control repository
who need to rebuild the configure and Makefile.in files should
use the script support/reconfig for this purpose.

To install PolyORB, execute:

  % ./configure [some options]
  % make              (or gmake if your make is not GNU make)
  % make install      (ditto)

This will install files in standard locations.

If you want to choose another prefix than /usr/local, give configure a
--prefix=whereveryouwant argument.

Note: at this time, you MUST use GNU make to compile this software.

Available options for the 'configure' script include:

  --with-appli-perso="...": application personalities to build
      Available personalities: CORBA, DSA, MOMA
      e.g.   --with-appli-perso="corba moma" to build both the CORBA 
             and MOMA personalities

  --with-proto-perso="...": personalities to build
      Available personalities: GIOP, SOAP, SRP
      e.g.   --with-proto-perso="giop soap" to build both the GIOP 
             and SOAP personalities

  --with-services="...": CORBA COS services to build
      Available services: event, ir, naming, time
      e.g.  --with-services="event naming" to build only
      COS Event and COS Naming.	

By default, only the CORBA and GIOP personalities are built, no CORBA
Services are built.

  --enable-shared: build shared libraries.

  --enable-debug:  enable debugging information generation and supplementary
                   runtime checks.

The following environment variables can be used to override configure's
guess at what compilers to use:
  CC:  the C compiler
  ADA: the Ada 95 compiler

For example, if you have two versions of GNAT installed and available
in your PATH, and configure picks the wrong one, you can indicate
what compiler should be used with the following syntax:

ADA=/path/to/good/compiler/gcc ./configure [options]

Platform notes
--------------

Solaris 2.8:

  * /usr/bin/sed and /usr/ucb/sed will silently chop long
    lines, and /usr/xpg4/bin/sed will enter an endless loop while
    processing PolyORB files.
    GNU sed is required to configure and build PolyORB.

  * /usr/ucb/tr does not handle control character escape sequences: it
    cannot be used to recompute dependencies ('make depend');
    /usr/bin/tr or /usr/xpg4/bin/tr must be used.
