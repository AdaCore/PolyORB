NOTE: THIS FILE APPLIES ONLY TO GLADE __glade_version__. IF YOU HAVE ANY
      OTHER VERSION OF GLADE, PLEASE GET THE APPROPRIATE INSTALL FILE.

INSTALL for GLADE
-----------------

You can find general information about GLADE in README and in
Doc/user_guide.txt. Here are simple steps for building GLADE
easily. More details about installation and configuration can be found
in Doc/install_guide.txt.


1. Check your environment
   - verify that GNAT __gnat_version__ has been installed and is on your path
   - verify that GLADE has been ported to your system (see README)
   - GLADE is usually built with GNU make. It may or may not be built 
     with other versions of make. If you have problems building GLADE
     with your local make tool, switch to GNU make.
   - verify that you will be able to run distributed applications
      (on Unix, your .rhosts file must contain the machine from which
       you will start the distributed application).
   - if you are building GLADE for a Linux platform, make sure that you use
     the native threads library, not the FSU one.

2. Configure GLADE
   GLADE uses standard the GNU configuration method. Run 
           ./configure  [configuration parameters]

   Configuration parameters can be used to define the
   build/host/target machines, installation locations and other
   customizations (see Doc/install_guide.txt for details). By default,
   when no parameters are specified, the build machine is used as host
   and target and installation is done in /usr/local. It is advised to
   install GLADE first in a private directory for testing purposes.
   This can be done by using the --prefix parameter, for instance:

      ./configure --prefix=$HOME/glade

   See the section "Building GLADE under Windows NT" for NT specific
   information.

3. Build & install GLADE
      this can be achieved simply by doing 
         make install
      in the main GLADE directory. Be careful, you usually need root
      privileges to install software in /usr/local.

4. Test your installation by running the Examples
   Go in the Example directory and run simply 'make'. Then, go in each
   example directory and start the applications. Check also the README
   in each example directory.

5.  Example of complete build (assuming csh syntax):

% cd                             <--- go into your HOME directory
% gunzip glade-__glade_version__.tar.gz     <--- uncompress the distribution
% tar xf glade-__glade_version__.tar        <--- explode the distribution
% cd glade-__glade_version__                <--- go into the distribution dir.
% ./configure --prefix=`pwd`     <--- configure the Makefiles using the current
                                      directory to install the binaries
% make install                   <--- compile files and install them
% set path=(`pwd`/bin $path)     <--- add this directory in your PATH
% cd Examples                    <--- go in the Example directory
% make                           <--- build all the examples
% cd Eratho/absolute             <--- go in the first example directory
% ./mainloop                     <--- run the distributed application


Building GLADE under Windows NT
-------------------------------

1) To build GLADE under NT you must have some NT replacement for the
   followings UNIX tools :

	bash.exe
	cat.exe
	chmod.exe
	cmp.exe
	cp.exe
	echo.exe
	expr.exe
	false
	grep.exe
	install.exe
	ls.exe
	mkdir.exe
	mv.exe
	rm.exe
	sed.exe
	sleep.exe
	uname.exe

   All these tools can be found in the Cygwin or MSYS environment.

   Some others tools are needed but they are provided with the GNAT for NT
   distribution :

	ar.exe
	make.exe
	ranlib.exe

2) If using the Cygwin environment you also need to specify the host/target
   triplet when configuring GLADE.

      $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/gnatpro/5.03a1 --build=i686-pc-mingw32

   Special care must be done for the --prefix argument. The directory
   specified here must be accessible from Cygwin and Windows and point to the
   same directory. With a default Cygwin installation /opt will probably be
   looked for into c:\cygwin\opt as / is mapped to c:\cygwin (Cygwin
   root). The solution is to mount /opt to point to c:\opt in this case.

      $ mount -b c:\opt /opt

   This way c:\opt (on Windows, PATH used by the native build of GLADE) and
   /opt on Cygwin side are referencing the same directory.

   This is very important to have a proper GLADE installation.
