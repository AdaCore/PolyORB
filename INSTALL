This file details the compilation and installation of PolyORB.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

PolyORB has been compiled and successfully tested on the following platforms:

- FreeBSD
- HP-UX
- Linux
- Solaris
- Windows

Build requirements
------------------

Ada 95 compiler: GNAT 3.15a (or the public release 3.15p) or later.

Optional: XmlAda (http://libre.act-europe.fr/xmlada/) if you want to
build the SOAP protocol personality.

Note: per construction, the macro used to detect your GNAT compiler
looks first to the executables 'gnatgcc', then 'adagcc' and finally to
'gcc' to find out which Ada compiler to use. You should be very
careful with your path and executables if you have multiple GNAT
versions installed.

Build instructions
------------------

NOTE: Developers building PolyORB from the version control repository
who need to rebuild the configure and Makefile.in files should
use the script support/reconfig for this purpose.

To install PolyORB, execute:

  % ./configure [some options]
  % make              (or gmake if your make is not GNU make)
  % make install      (ditto)

This will install files in standard locations.

If you want to choose another prefix than /usr/local, give configure a
--prefix=whereveryouwant argument.

Note: at this time, you MUST use GNU make to compile this software.

Available options for the 'configure' script include:
  --with-appli-perso=".." : application personalities to build, among
                            CORBA, DSA, MOMA
      e.g.   --with-appli-perso="corba moma" to build both the CORBA 
             and MOMA personnalities

  --with-proto-perso=".." : personalities to build, among
                            GIOP, SOAP, SRP
      e.g.   --with-proto-perso="giop soap" to build both the GIOP 
             and SOAP personnalities

  --with-services=".." : CORBA COS services to build : event, ir, naming, time
      e.g.  --with-services="event naming" to build only COS Event and COS Naming.	

  --enable-shared : build shared libraries.
  --enable-debug  : enable debugging information generation and supplementary
                    runtime checks.

By default, only the CORBA and GIOP personalities are built, no CORBA
Services are built.

Platform notes
--------------

Solaris 2.8:

  * /usr/bin/sed and /usr/ucb/sed will silently chop long
    lines, and /usr/xpg4/bin/sed will enter an endless loop while
    processing PolyORB files.
    GNU sed is required to configure and build PolyORB.

  * /usr/ucb/tr does not handle control character escape sequences: it
    cannot be used to recompute dependencies ('make depend');
    /usr/bin/tr or /usr/xpg4/bin/tr must be used.
