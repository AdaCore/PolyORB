This file details the compilation and installation of PolyORB.

For more details about build requirements, supported compilers,
supported platforms and platform-specific information, please refer
to the PolyORB User's Guide.

Build instructions
------------------

NOTE: Developers building PolyORB from the version control repository
who need to rebuild the configure and Makefile.in files should run the
following command from within the top-level source dir:

  % support/reconfig

This should be done after each update from the repository.
In addition to the requirements above, they will need autoconf 2.60 or
newer, automake 1.6.3 or newer, and libtool 1.5.8 or newer.

To install PolyORB, execute:

  % ./configure [some options]
  % make
  % make install

This will install files in standard locations.

If you want to choose another prefix than /usr/local, give configure a
--prefix=whereveryouwant argument.

NOTE: you MUST use GNU make (version 3.80 or later) to build PolyORB.

Available options for the 'configure' script include:

  --with-appli-perso="...": application personalities to build
      Available personalities: CORBA, DSA, MOMA
      e.g.   --with-appli-perso="corba moma" to build both the CORBA 
             and MOMA personalities

  --with-proto-perso="...": personalities to build
      Available personalities: GIOP, SOAP, SRP
      e.g.   --with-proto-perso="giop soap" to build both the GIOP 
             and SOAP personalities

  --with-corba-services="...": CORBA COS services to build
      Available services: event, ir, naming, notification, time
      e.g.  --with-corba-services="event naming" to build only
      COS Event and COS Naming.	

  --with-openssl[=ARG]: build SSL support and SSL dependent features,
    including the IIOP/SSLIOP personality

  --with-gnatcoll: build with GNATCOLL support

  --help: list all options available

By default, only the CORBA and GIOP personalities are built, no CORBA
Services are built.

  --enable-shared:    build shared libraries.

  --enable-debug:     enable debugging information generation and supplementary
                      runtime checks.

  --enable-debug=all: like the above, and also enable full validity checks

The following environment variables can be used to override configure's
guess at what compilers to use:
  CC:  the C compiler
  ADA: the Ada 95 compiler (e.g. gcc, gnatgcc or adagcc)

For example, if you have two versions of GNAT installed and available
in your PATH, and configure picks the wrong one, you can indicate
what compiler should be used with the following syntax:

ADA=/path/to/good/compiler/gcc ./configure [options]
