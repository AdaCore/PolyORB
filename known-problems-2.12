Known problems in 2.12.1
------------------------

KP-212-P120-017 po_gnatdist handling of --unchecked-shared-lib-imports

  Problem:    Partitioning fails if the project tree requires
              --unchecked-shared-lib-imports, as this option is not
              passed down to "gnat ls".

  Status:     This was fixed in 17.0 on 2016-02-08

  Workaround: Reorganize projects to use static libraries.
