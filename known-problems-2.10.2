KP-2102-N117-032 Memory leak in COS Naming server

  Problem:    The po_cos_naming name server leaks memory each time a name
              is bound.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.11 on 2014-01-17

  Workaround: Periodically restart the name server if its memory footprint
              grows too much.
