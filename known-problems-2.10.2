Known problems in PolyORB 2.10.2
================================

Copyright (C) 2014, AdaCore

The following is a listing of known problems in release 2.9. Except where
specifically noted, all these problems have been corrected in the final
release of the 2.10 technology. This means they are corrected in release
2.10 and in any wavefront issued subsequent to the date specified (in
ISO format YYYY-MM-DD) in the status line. This can be used to determine
if a given wavefront has the fix identified in the entry.

KP-2102-N127-066 -ffreestanding required for recent g++ preprocessor

  Problem:    When IAC uses a GCC 4.8 C++ preprocessor to preprocess IDL
              files, -ffreestanding needs to be passed on the preprocessor
              command line to prevent the automatic preinclusion of C
              header file stdc-predef.h.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.11 on 2014-01-28

  Workaround: Set environment variable CXXCPP to "g++ -E -ffreestanding" when
              configuring PolyORB using an affected g++ compiler.

KP-2102-N117-032 Memory leak in COS Naming server

  Problem:    The po_cos_naming name server leaks memory each time a name
              is bound.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.11 on 2014-01-17

  Workaround: Periodically restart the name server if its memory footprint
              grows too much.
