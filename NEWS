Changes since GLADE 1.01
========================

* New examples Bank and LightBank. LightBank is an example of 
  client / server application written in Ada 95 and Annex E. 
  Bank is a more sophisticated example with distributed objects 
  and filtering.

* Addition of filters. A filter is a set of subprograms which will be
  called automatically before sending bytes on the communication
  channel and after receiving them. An example (the ZIP filter) is
  bundled and install along with GLADE, which uses the zlib
  library. There are new pragmas and attributes in GNATDIST to use
  this feature.

* It is possible to pass two new predefined arguments --trace and --replay
  to a partition. In tracing mode, network inputs and outputs are logged
  such a way that when the partition executable is invoked with arguments
  --replay, inputs and outputs are read from the log files. Therefore,
  you can easily debug your distributed application without any
  non-deterministic side effects.

* Copies of buffers have been suppressed wherever possible, thus
  decreasing execution time.

* The 'rsh' command can now be changed at installation time using the
  --with-remsh parameter of configure.

* Upgraded to automake 1.1n. If the user does modifies sensitive files 
  (such as Makefile.am) and does not have automake, then print a
  message instead of crashing with an unclear error.

* Bug fixes for float transmissions between architectures with
  different word sizes.

* Bug fixes for pathological cases in GNATDIST.

* Reorganisation of GNATDIST directory hierarchy.

* Clearer error messages for GNATDIST.

* New file NEWS (this file).
