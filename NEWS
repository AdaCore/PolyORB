Changes since GLADE 1.03
========================

New Functionnalities
--------------------

  * Local launching
    If the host on which a partition must be launched is detected as
    being the same as localhost (same official name or name
    "localhost"), then rsh is not used any more and partitions are
    launched using system().

  * Light PCS
    If a partition does not contain any RCI body and does not have the 
    possibility of defining local RACW entities, then no anonymous
    task is ever started, in order to avoid creating tasks which will
    never be used.

  * gnat.adc
    gnatdist handles gnat.adc.

  * Version checks
    If a RCI version id is a blank string, then the version check is
    always considered as true.

New Ports
---------

  * Digital Unix
    GLADE now works correctly on Digital Unix. Heterogeneous
    distribution involving Digital Unix platforms is not yet
    supported. Compilation must use -O0 instead of -O2 to prevent a
    bug at runtime. The zlib library seems to be broken on Digital
    Unix. Therefore, the zip filter is not available.

Changes since GLADE 1.02
========================

New Functionnalities
--------------------

  * Task pools
    Up to GLADE 1.02, a new task was created for each incoming
    request. Now, tasks are reused and are pre-created using a
    low-priority background allocator to allow requests to be served
    sooner. The number of awaiting tasks is configurable through
    GNATDIST configuration files on a per-partition basis or system-wide.

  * Informative exception messages
    When the TCP module fails, the errno return code is stored in the
    exception message to allow easier debugging.

Misc
----

  * Various code cleanups.

Changes since GLADE 1.01
========================

New Functionnalities
--------------------

  * Filters. 
    A filter is a set of subprograms which will be called
    automatically before sending bytes on the communication channel
    and after receiving them. An example (the ZIP filter) is bundled
    and installed along with GLADE, which uses the zlib library.
    There are new pragmas and attributes in GNATDIST to use this
    feature.

  * Trace and Replay
    It is possible to pass two new predefined arguments --trace and
    --replay to a partition. In tracing mode, network inputs and
    outputs are logged in such a way that when the partition
    executable is invoked with arguments --replay, inputs and outputs
    are read from the log files. Therefore, you can easily debug your
    distributed application without any non-deterministic side
    effects.

Examples
---------

   * LightBank 
     It is a simple example of client/server application written in
     Ada 95 and Annex E. Shows in particular how a simple partition
     (the client) can be duplicated at will. 

   * Bank 
     A more sophisticated example on the same theme. It demonstrates 
     distributed objects and filtering.

Bug fixes
---------

   * Float transmissions between different architectures with
     different word sizes now work.

   * Pathological cases in GNATDIST.

Misc
----

   * Copies of buffers have been suppressed wherever possible, thus
     decreasing execution time.

   * The 'rsh' command can now be changed at installation time using the
      --with-remsh parameter of configure (in preparation for HP support)

   * Upgraded to automake 1.1n. If the user does modifies sensitive files 
     (such as Makefile.am) and does not have automake, then print a
     message instead of crashing with an unclear error.

   * Reorganisation of GNATDIST directory hierarchy.

   * Clearer error messages for GNATDIST.

   * New file NEWS (this file).
