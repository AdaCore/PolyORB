AdaBroker news
--------------

New features in version XXX
===========================

New command line switch: '-p', output all generated
packages concatenated on standard output (in a form
suitable for gnatchop).

Incompatible changes in version XXX
===================================

When invoking idlac with the '-i' command line switch
to generate an implementation template, only the implementation
template (and not the stubs, skeletons and streams packages)
is produced.

New features in version 1.0pre1
===============================

A new IDL to Ada compiler, idlac, written entirely
in Ada 95. No more C++ code, and no need for the
Sun IDL front-end. The build process is now
automated using GNU Automake/Autoconf.

New features in version 0.9
===========================

The omniORB library has been completely replaced by
an ORB written in Ada, Broca. The only remaining
omniORB part in AdaBroker is the IDL compiler
front-end (from Sun) and the target-independent
layer of the back-end (from omniORB).
