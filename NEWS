Changes since GLADE 1.02
========================

New Functionnalities
--------------------

  * Shared libraries
    If shared libraries are available on the target system, then a
    shared version of GLADE library is built along with the static
    version. The static version will be chosen if -static flag has
    been given to GNATDIST.

  * Task pools
    Up to GLADE 1.02, a new task was created for each incoming
    request. Now, tasks are reused and are pre-created using a
    low-priority background allocator to allow requests to be served
    sooner. The number of awaiting tasks is configurable through
    GNATDIST configuration files on a per-partition basis or system-wide.

Changes since GLADE 1.01
========================

New Functionnalities
--------------------

  * Filters. 
    A filter is a set of subprograms which will be called
    automatically before sending bytes on the communication channel
    and after receiving them. An example (the ZIP filter) is bundled
    and installed along with GLADE, which uses the zlib library.
    There are new pragmas and attributes in GNATDIST to use this
    feature.

  * Trace and Replay
    It is possible to pass two new predefined arguments --trace and
    --replay to a partition. In tracing mode, network inputs and
    outputs are logged in such a way that when the partition
    executable is invoked with arguments --replay, inputs and outputs
    are read from the log files. Therefore, you can easily debug your
    distributed application without any non-deterministic side
    effects.

Examples
---------

   * LightBank 
     It is a simple example of client/server application written in
     Ada 95 and Annex E. Shows in particular how a simple partition
     (the client) can be duplicated at will. 

   * Bank 
     A more sophisticated example on the same theme. It demonstrates 
     distributed objects and filtering.

Bug fixes
---------

   * Float transmissions between different architectures with
     different word sizes now work.

   * Pathological cases in GNATDIST.

Misc
----

   * Copies of buffers have been suppressed wherever possible, thus
     decreasing execution time.

   * The 'rsh' command can now be changed at installation time using the
      --with-remsh parameter of configure (in preparation for HP support)

   * Upgraded to automake 1.1n. If the user does modifies sensitive files 
     (such as Makefile.am) and does not have automake, then print a
     message instead of crashing with an unclear error.

   * Reorganisation of GNATDIST directory hierarchy.

   * Clearer error messages for GNATDIST.

   * New file NEWS (this file).
