* PolyORB 1.O (released 2003-06-16)

This release contains a CORBA-compliant instantiation of the PolyORB
generic middleware. It includes:
- an IDL to Ada 95 compiler,
- Portable Object Adapter (POA),
Dynamic Skeleton Interface (DSI),
Dynamic Invocation Interface (DII), and
Interface Repository (IR) implementations,
- COS Naming, COS Event and COS Time services implementations,
- GIOP 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 implementations.

This CORBA implementation can be configured for full tasking,
Ravenscar tasking or no tasking runtime, depending on the level
of desired functionality for the application, and on the resource
constraints for the target.

This release should be considered as a stable implementation of
CORBA middleware over PolyORB.

* PolyORB 0.1 (released 2001-12-04)

This is the first public release of PolyORB code. This release
contains the personality-neutral middleware core, the CORBA
application personality (including our IDL -> Ada 95 compiler idlac),
and CORBA and SOAP protocol personalities.  This should be considered
as test-phase software.
