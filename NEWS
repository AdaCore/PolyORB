------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* PolyORB 2.9
=============

This release contains the PolyORB generic middleware, and its CORBA
and DSA instantiations. In addition to the 2.8 release, it includes:

New features
------------

See the features-29 file.

Bug fixes
---------

Abortion of a task blocked trying to bind a reference would leave the
reference locked, causing further bind attemps to hang. (KC09-001)

DSA RPC receivers were activated too early (before the partition was
completely elaborated), which could cause access before elaboration
while servicing remote calls. (KC22-022)

* PolyORB 2.8 (branched on 2011-10-31)
======================================

This release contains the PolyORB generic middleware, and its CORBA
and DSA instantiations. In addition to the 2.7 release, it includes:

New features
------------

See the features-28 file.

Bug fixes
---------

Several race conditions related to session reuse have been identified and
corrected. (K915-014, K915-018, K915-019)

Several minor memory leaks have been identified and corrected.

po_gnatdist would not correctly handle "-P" (project file) command line
switches when building a single partition. (K427-033)

po_gnatdist would crash when building a single partition out of a configuration
and reconnection policy settings are specified in the configuration file.
(K426-016)

In some cases, incorrect integer representations were selected on 64 bit
architectures, causing interoperability issues in DSA applications mixing
32-bit and 64-bit partitions. (K201-041)

A rare race condition might cause PolyORB partitions to perform an incorrect
memory access, causing the partition to crash. (K121-014)

Implementation template package specs for empty interfaces lacked a pragma
Elaborate_Body to make their body legal (the body is necessary to drag the
Skel into the closure). (JA27-008)

* PolyORB 2.7 (branched on 2010-10-01)
======================================

This release contains the PolyORB generic middleware, and its CORBA
and DSA instantiations. In addition to the 2.6 release, it includes:

New features
------------

See the features-27 file.

Bug fixes
---------

Boolean values in composite user data might in some rare cases be incorrectly
handled, causing the wrong value to be transmitted, or an application crash.
(JB04-017)

A range check would fail in PolyORB.CORBA_P.Naming_Tools.Locate for names
less than four characters in length. (JA26-018)

The iac compiler failed to check the rule that requires IDL keywords to have
the correct case (for example, "any" is correct, but "ANY" is wrong).
(J921-012)

The iac compiler generated illegal Ada for helpers in the case of an
enum type called 'Result'. (J701-270)

The iac compiler did not handle modules that come in multiple parts
correcly. The parts should all be considered part of the same
module. (IA01-028)

The global termination management circuitry would erroneously terminate
the initiator partition when all partitions have deferred termination
policy. (J602-015)

In some cases, po_gnatdist failed to identify that a partition required
re-linking after a source change. (J607-021)

The global termination policy in a DSA application might fail to detect
application termination if a partition with local termination had been
executed and completed. (J524-001)

PolyORB failed to execute a shell command specified as a partition's Host
attribute. (J521-020)

IAC would incorrectly generate redundant perfect hash function packages
for interfaces declared in a scope nested within an imported module. (J504-010)

A remote call occurring after the target partition of another previous call
had been disconnected could cause a hang on the calling side. (J511-002)

The -p option of iac is supposed to send the output to standard output, but it
was sending part of the output (the perfect hash function) to files. (J503-020)

Various minor memory leaks were fixed. (J420-020)

An IDL enumeration literal "SYSTEM" would cause a name clash in generated
code. (J412-032)

A call with a formal parameter of a composite type could cause an erroneous
memory access if the caller and callee were on the same partition. (J409-001)

The "install" Makefile target would fail to copy po_gnatdist to its proper
location on hosts where the system does not provide the install(1) command,
and the internal support/install-sh script is used instead. (J309-020)

Incoming multicast datagrams received on a MIOP access point were not
correctly identified as referring to a local object on Windows. (J312-020)

When referring to an enumeration literal in another package, IAC was generating
just the literal, whereas an expanded name like Package_Name.Literal is
needed. (J210-035)

Incorrect casing was used in IAC for the generated stubs and skeletons
for attribute access subprograms (_get_ and _set_). This could lead to
interoperability issues with conformant 3rd party ORBs. (J126-028)

Source units imported from AWS for the SOAP protocol personality have been
renamed to avoid clashes in applications mixing PolyORB and AWS. (J105-013)

Support for partition attribute Reconnection was missing. (IB12-005)

po_gnatdist does not create files anymore outside of the private dsa/
subdirectory. (IC14-034)

* PolyORB 2.6 (branched on 2009-10-07)
======================================

This release contains the PolyORB generic middleware, and its CORBA
and DSA instantiations. In addition to the 2.5 release, it includes:

New features
------------

See the features-26 file.

Bug fixes
---------

A socket leak occurring when an attempt to establish a TCP connection fails
has been fixed. (J106-008)

A segmentation fault could occur while unmarshalling a record with a component
of a private type. (IC16-046)

PROGRAM_ERROR was raised when performing a local call involving IDL union
with a switch that do not have an associated member label. (IB25-010)

A resource leak was fixed in the idle tasks manager. (IB19-027)

A race condition has been fixed in the Half_Sync_Half_Async ORB controller
that could cause a segmentation fault during ORB shutdown in some rare
cases. (IB19-024)

Several unrelated race conditions could cause crashes in the DSA termination
process in some timing-dependent scenarios. (IB13-026)

po_gnatdist would fail to build a slave partition alone. (IA29-009)

IAC would fail to find the output from the C++ preprocessor when running
under some recent versions of Cygwin. (IA08-013)

Constrained types derived from unconstrained array types were not correctly
handled in the DSA applicative personality, causing runtime exceptions
when such types were passed in remote calls. (IA06-020)

IAC was failing to properly detect an error in case a name that should refer
to a type referred to something else. (I629-006)

DSA partitions used to start processing remote calls before the local
partition ID was set, potentially causing exception messages to not be
tagged with the partition ID (if raised before that point). (I529-013)

The Ada DSA starter would fail if the complete path of some slave partition
contained white space. (I519-025)

When building a DSA application, a global configuration pragmas file
provided through a user project wasn't taken into account. (I513-015)

Building a DSA application in a directory whose complete path include
white space was not correctly handled. (I508-017)

* PolyORB 2.5 (branched on 2008-11-03)
======================================

This release contains the PolyORB generic middleware, and its CORBA
and DSA instantiations. In addition to the 2.4 release, it includes:

New features
------------

See the features-25 file.

Bug fixes
---------

When building a single partition with non-local termination, po_gnatdist
would systematically mark the partition as termination initiator, possibly
causing a deadlock when terminating the application. (Building all partitions
at the same time, which is the default, worked fine.) (HA30-008)

Calling a method that has IN or INOUT arguments following an OUT argument
locally on a partition (i.e. without involving any actual network
communication) would cause an incorrect matching of formal and actual
parameters, causing incorrect values to be passed to the servant, or
a crash if parameters were of incompatible types. (HB25-017)

po_gnatdist crashed when building only the main partition in an application
with an Ada starter. (HB10-009)

Constraint_Error could be raised when calculating the number of tasks in a
thread pool; this has been corrected. (HA02-018)

IAC was generating incorrect Ada code for "default:" in a union. (H930-022)

Several issues have been fixed in the circuitry handling TypeCodes and Anys
for bounded string types. (H904-029)

IAC was failing to correctly parse arrays and strings whose length was given by
a named constant. (H813-030, H813-031)

The tasks management circuitry has undergone a major overhaul to make
it more robust and remove some irregularities in the assignment of
particular ORB jobs to application tasks. This extensive change fixes
dead locks (G510-007, H813-026) and invariant violations (H813-027,
H828-032) which could happen under some specific scheduling situations.

CORBA.Object.Hash might under some circumstances return different values
for the same object. This has been fixed. (H806-014)

IAC did not generate all code in user-specified output directory when
using hash optimizations, this is now corrected. (H730-014)

IAC incorrectly rejected negative real literals. They are now accpted.
Workaround: add a pair of parentheses around the absolute value. (H728-026)

IAC and IDLAC required array sizes to be literals or constants. Arbitrary
integer expressions are now allowed. Workaround: introduce a named
constant. (H723-024)

IAC would generate garbled error messages when referring to declarations in
#include files, such as "X" conflicts with declaration at included.idl:12:03.
Workaround: fix the underlying error.
(H723-022)

IDL real literals starting with "0." were erroneously rejected by IAC.
Workaround: use an expression yielding the same value but avoiding such
literals.
(H721-014)

IDL constants of a bounded string type were not handled correctly by the
IDL to Ada compilers. Both have been fixed. (H707-023)

If the tasking policy is Thread_Pool, the ORB could borrow user tasks to handle
Request_Jobs, which could cause long waiting times, or even deadlock in some
cases. (G510-007)

IAC would generate garbled error messages when referring to declarations in
#include files, such as "X" conflicts with declaration at included.idl:12:03.
(H723-022).

IAC and IDLAC required array sizes to be literals or constants. Arbitrary
integer expressions are now allowed. (H723-024).

Leading separator characters were not ignored by PolyORB.CORBA_P.Naming_Tools.
Parse_Name as documented. (H513-025)

* PolyORB 2.4 (branched on 2008-05-06)
======================================

This release contains the PolyORB generic middleware, and its CORBA
and DSA instantiations. In addition to the 2.3 release, it includes:

New features
------------

See the features-24 file.

Bug fixes
---------

In PolyORB/DSA, references to RACW or RAS stream attributes in user code
were not handled correctly. (H407-010)

There was a bug in the function that determined wether a MIOP profile
is local to a partition, this has been corrected. (H303-005)

A PolyORB partition configured to use MIOP 1.0 did not default to GIOP
1.2, this has been corrected. (H303-004)

Two issues were fixed in the decoding of MIOP headers (H228-015).

The GIOP implementation rejected messages where reserved bytes had
non-zero value, causing interoperability issues with TAO (H124-010).

A PolyORB partition configured to use GIOP version 1.0 only was unable
to connect to a server providing an IIOP 1.2 profile. The GIOP stack
now gracefully degrades the connection to GIOP 1.0. (H110-024)

Host names are now kept unresolved in profiles. This allows a partition
to unmarshall, process and marshall back an object reference even when
the host name contained in the reference cannot be resolved to an IP
address (this is useful for example on a name server which serves references
provided by clients, but does not need to connect directly to the
referenced objects). (H107-031)

* PolyORB 2.3 (branched on 2008-01-07)
======================================

This release contains the PolyORB generic middleware, and its CORBA
and DSA instantiations. In addition to the 2.2 release, it includes:

New features
------------

See the features-23 file.

Bug fixes
---------

Receiving an out-of-range value for an enumerated type (which can occur
when the sending side passes an uninitialized object with invalid
representation) would cause a segmentation fault in some contexts instead
of propagating an exception. (G328-007)

The CDR unmarshalling routines did not support indirect typecode references.
(G328-027)

Parsing of PolyORB's specific command line parameters in po_cos_naming
was not working. This has been corrected. (G326-002)

The client side GIOP version selection mechanism was incorrect. Version
1.2 was always assumed, even when the server reference specified a
different version. (G323-025)

The CDR unmarshalling for TypeCode objects of kind Union was incorrect.
(G326-004)

IDLAC would generate incorrect code when an IDL file declared a constant
called "Standard". (G322-037)

IDLAC would generate incorrect code when an IDL file declared a type
called "Empty". (G322-036)

* PolyORB 2.2 (branched on 2007-01-10)
======================================

This release contains a CORBA-compatible instantiation of the PolyORB
generic middleware. In addition to the 2.1 release, it includes:

New features
------------

See the features-22 file.

New applicative personality: dsa (Ada Distributed Systems Annex).

The code footprint and compile time for instances of PolyORB.Sequences.Bounded
and PolyORB.Sequences.Unbounded has been significantly reduced thanks to a
complete redesign that allowed significant code sharing across instances.
(10469)

Added the possibility to define a default listen address for the DIOP
protocol personality. (10377)

po_cos_naming has a new flag '-file', that outputs the server IOR in a
file. (10283)

Client binding objects are reused when possible, reducing the
number of open channels between nodes. (10072)

Added new service context to GIOP to pass server-side exception
information to the reply. (10051)

Major run-time performance improvements for the CORBA applicative
personality.

Completed the support for GIOP addressing modes. (10046)

Bug fixes
---------

A number of issues have been fixed with the subprograms in
PolyORB.Sequences.Bounded and PolyORB.Sequences.Unbounded. Their behaviour
is now closely aligned on Ada.Strings.Bounded and Ada.Strings.Unbounded,
as per the CORBA specification. (10469)

Marshalling and unmarshalling errors for aggregates are now correctly
reported (previously a marshalling error in a reply would not correctly
be notified as an exception to the client). (10432)

Unwanted validity checks were generated in helpers for enumeration types,
causing CONSTRAINT_ERROR to be erroneously raised when using pragma
Initialize_Scalars. (10396)

An incorrect type name was used for the POAManager reference type. It has been
fixed to be conformant with the standard Ada mapping. This may require an
update of user code; see "Incompatible changes" below. (10361)

PortableServer package incorrectly defined helper functions. These have been
moved in the PortableServer.Helper package to ensure code generated by idlac
compiles correctly; see "Incompatible changes" below. (10357)

idlac generated helper functions for types with local components, resulting in
code that does not compile. This has been corrected. (10354)

An incorrect type name was used for the list of POAs type. It has been fixed
to be conformant with the standard Ada mapping. This may require an update of
user code; see "Incompatible changes" below. (10345)

An incorrect type name was used for the POA reference type. It has been fixed
to be conformant with the standard Ada mapping. This may require an update of
user code; see "Incompatible changes" below. (10337)

A permissions issue with the polyorb-config script has been fixed. (10214)

A long-standing bug in the CDR library would cause an incorrect representation
to be used for fixed point values (leading zeroes were incorrectly omitted),
causing failures to interoperate with third-party CORBA implementations.
(10178)

PortableServer.POA.Reference_To_Id would raise the WrongAdapter exception if
it fails. (10159)

CORBA.Is_Equivalent has been fixed to correctly determine when two references
designate the same remote object (same remote node and same object key).
(10124)

The From_Any function generated for sequences of discriminated unions would
raise CONSTRAINT_ERROR on sequence elements with a discriminant value other
than the default one. (10087)

PortableServer.POA.Reference_To_Id would raise an exception in the case of
a POA with the USE_DEFAULT_SERVANT request processing policy. (10070)

Incompatible changes
--------------------

The reference type for the PortableServer::POA object is a local one,
PortableServer.POA.Local_Ref. The conversion subprograms To_Ref and
Unchecked_To_Ref have been accordingly renamed To_Local_Ref and
Unchecked_To_Local_Ref, for consistency with the standard mapping.
(41599)

In CORBA.Sequences, subprogram Element_Of has been removed. It was a
non-standard renaming of the Get_Element function specified by the
Ada language mapping. Get_Element should be used instead. (10443)

In the CORBA personality, the PortableServer.POAManager.Ref type has been
renamed to PortableServer.POAManager.Local_Ref to be conformant with the
IDL-to-Ada mapping. This fixes a conformance defect of PolyORB with respect to
the CORBA standards; user code that references this type must be fixed
accordingly. (10361)

In the CORBA personality, the PortableServer package incorrectly defined
helper functions. These have been moved in the PortableServer.Helper package.
User code that references these functions must be fixed accordingly. (10357)

In the CORBA personality, the PortableServer.IDL_SEQUENCE_POA_Forward
package has been renamed to
PortableServer.IDL_SEQUENCE_PortableServer_POA_Forward to be conformant with
the IDL-to-Ada mapping. This fixes a conformance defect of PolyORB with
respect to the CORBA standards; user code that references this type must be
fixed accordingly. (10345)

In the CORBA personality, the PortableServer.POA.Ref type has been renamed to
PortableServer.POA.Local_Ref to be conformant with the IDL-to-Ada mapping.
This fixes a conformance defect of PolyORB with respect to the CORBA standards;
user code that references this type must be fixed accordingly. (10337)

In PolyORB.Initialization, the type Module_Info has a new component
Shutdown to specify a shutdown hook. Calls to
PolyORB.Initialization.Register_Module must therefore provide a value for the
new component.
A null value should be used for modules that do not make use of this new
feature. (10315)

Building idlac now requires an Ada 2005 compiler supporting Ada.Containers.

* PolyORB 2.1 (branched on 2006-05-11)
======================================

This release contains a CORBA-compatible instantiation of the PolyORB
generic middleware. In addition to the 2.0 release, it includes:

New features
------------

Exceptions raised during modules initialization are now caught and reported.
(9795)

EXTRA_GNATMAKE_FLAGS are now honored throughout the PolyORB build process,
not just for examples and the test suite. (9846)

ORB Controllers now support multiple event source monitors. This allows one
partition to simultaneously support plain TCP/IP and SSL sockets, e.g. CORBA
node using both IIOP and SSLIOP. (9850)

Idlac does not generate with or use clauses in package bodies anymore if the
same clause already appears in the corresponding package spec. (9853)

Idlac can now generate only client-side or server-side code on
demand. (9899)

The blocking variant of ORB.Shutdown is now implemented: when ORB shutdown
with wait for request completion is requested, the ORB blocks until the ORB
controller signals completion of all remaining tasks. (9912)

GIOP now supports Unicode UTF-8 and UTF-16 code sets; a new configuration
parameter has been added to force the inclusion of fallback GIOP code sets
converters in the object reference. (9954)

Documention PolyORB's framework to support new GIOP code sets has been
added. (9955)

An implementation object type is provided for CORBA::Current, allowing
users to implement derived interfaces of CORBA::Current using the default
implementation template. (9960)

Support for the CosNaming::CosNamingContextExt interface. (10300)

Bug fixes
---------

A missing initialization dependency of helpers upon "any" has been fixed.
(9811)

A race condition in the client-side processing of oneway requests could
cause a oneway call executed from a partition using tasks to hang. (9837)

Transport errors occurring on a session that has pending requests are now
correctly reported to the caller. When such an error occurs, each pending
request is now marked as completed with an error condition, and its target
reference is marked as unbound, allowing further calls to rebind them. (9882)

The CORBA::Object::non_existent implementation was incorrect on the server
side and has been fixed. (9888, 9892)

For a locality-constrained interface, generation of the Is_A primitive must
be under control of the Implement flag, not the Generate_Client_Code flag.
(9947)

Corrected several inconsistencies in PolyORB local shutdown facility
that prevent the correct shutdown of the ORB. (9937, 9938) 

Reordered error condition testing in
PortableServer.POA.Activate_Object_With_Id to prevent introducing
consistencies in the CORBA's personality POA. (9942)

Actually store user-defined POA policies in the POA. (9967)

Incompatible changes
--------------------

By default, the SOAP personality will now bind on an available port number.
To force it to bind to the previous default of 8080, use the
  polyorb.protocols.soap.default_addr
in the [soap] section of the configuration. (9793)

A typo has been fixed in the name of formal parameter ORB_Identifier of
procedure CORBA.ORB.Init (it was previously misspelt "ORB_Indentifier").
User code that uses a named parameter association for this parameter will
need to be fixed accordingly. (9919)

CORBA.Current.Ref was changed to Local_Ref to adjust to a change in the
CORBA specifications (between CORBA 2.3 and CORBA 3.0). (9951)

* PolyORB 2.0 (released 2006-03-07)
===================================

This new major release of PolyORB comes as the conclusion of a series of
extensive reviews and reorganisations of the middleware components,
improving the architecture's performances and flexibility. Development
has taken place in both the generic core and the various application
and protocol personalities.

This release contains the PolyORB generic middleware and its CORBA and MOMA
instances. In addition to the 1.3 release, it includes:

New features
------------

The stubs and skeletons generated by idlac now evaluate operation and argument
names only once at elaboration time, for improved efficiency. (9753)

The low-level mutex facility used under full tasking has been reimplemented
to take advantage of internal facilities provided by the GNAT runtime library,
providing a significant performance improvement. (9744)

The memory footprint of simply chained lists used internally has been reduced
by not storing a 'Prev' pointer in each list node for that case. (9719)

The output function used by the internal traces logging system is now set to
its default value (output to the standard error file descriptor) only if it is
unset. This makes it easier for users to override this value. (9717)

Added support for CORBA bounded strings and bounded wide strings.
(9696, 9697, 9701)

Support for SSLIOP, an instance of the GIOP generic protocol on top of the
SSL transport layer. (9520)

The Thread_Pool ORB tasking policy can now dynamically allocates new tasks
to handle higher workload. It uses three different parameters to control
minimum number of threads, maximum number of spare threads, maximum total
number of threads. See the PolyORB's User Guide for more details. (9515)

Support for 'file://' URL scheme. This allows stringified references (e.g.
IOR, corbaloc) to be read from a file. (9485)

Support for the Tag_Alternate_IIOP_Address GIOP tagged component. This allows
a node to listen on multiple sockets when using the GIOP/IIOP protocol
personality. (9473)

Idlac now annotates client stubs with comments indicating in which interface
each inherited operation has been declared (whether it is implicitly inherited
from the primary parent or redeclared from a secondary parent).
(9458, 9459, 9460)

Added support for the G++ 4.1.0 preprocessor. (9438)

New contrib/ directory to store contributed code. (9376)

Added idlac_wrapper, a script contributed by Vadim Godunko to avoid
unnecessary recompilation of idlac generated files. (9376)

Incompatible changes
--------------------

For a bounded sequence, the associated instance of CORBA.Sequences.Bounded is
now named IDL_Sequence_<size>_<type> in conformance with the example par. 3.8
of the IDL-to-Ada mapping. (9690)

Idlac now builds the names of accessor for attributes with the same casing as
in the specification for the IDL-to-Ada mapping: the accessors names are built
by prepending "Get_" and "Set_" to the the attribute name. (9636)

The casing of sequences packages is now "IDL_SEQUENCE", instead of
"IDL_Sequence" in conformance with section 3.8 of the IDL-to-Ada
mapping. (9632)

./configure now searches '--with-corba-services' instead of
'--with-services' for CORBA Services to build. (9597)

polyorb-config now returns list of CORBA services using
'--with-corba-services' instead of '--with-services'. (9597)

The "polyorb.tasking.threads.storage_size" parameter in section
[tasking] has been renamed to just "storage_size". Accordingly,
the environment variable to be used to override this value is now
POLYORB_TASKING_STORAGE_SIZE instead of
POLYORB_TASKING_POLYORB_TASKING_THREADS_STORAGE_SIZE. (9504)

The "polyorb.orb.thread_pool.threads" parameter in section [tasking] is
deprecated. The Thread_Pool ORB tasking policy is now configured using a set
of three parameters: min_spare_threads, max_spare_threads, and max_threads.
(9504)

CORBA specifications mandate that all standard minor exception codes should be
or'ed with the OMGVMCID constant (CORBA3 A.5). The CORBA and GIOP personalities
now handle this correctly. (9415)

The implementation of the PortableServer::ObjectId has been corrected to match
the IDL-to-Ada specifications, resulting in changes in the API. (9352)

Fixed bugs
----------

CORBA.ORB.String_To_Object used to raise non-CORBA exceptions for some cases
of malformed corbaloc URIs. This has been fixed. (9750)

The helpers for union types occasionally contained lines whose length
exceeded the default maximum length for GNAT (255 characters). The layout
of the generated code has been adapted to avoid exceeding this implementation
limit. (9710)

When a GIOP reply has been received, call Expect_GIOP_Header prior to
notifying the caller. Otherwise, the underlying binding object may disappear
too early, causing SOCKET_ERROR to be raised due to calling select(2) on a
closed socket fd. (9507)

When closing a socket, remove it from the monitored set prior to closing it.
Otherwise, a race condition occurs that can cause SOCKET_ERROR to be raised
due to calling select(2) on a closed socket fd. (9496)

Correct helper generation for typedefs. (9435)

In some cases, integer constants greater than 2**31 would not be processed
correctly and cause idlac to crash or generate incorrect code. (9377)

Correct handling of nested (anonymous) arrays. (9412)

Correct skeleton generation for functions returning references. (9411, 9424)

* PolyORB 1.3 (released 2005-06-20)
===================================

This release contains a CORBA-compatible instantiation of the PolyORB
generic middleware. In addition to the 1.2r release, it includes:

New features
------------

Base support for the DynamicAny interface. (9282)

The modularity of the Neutral Core Layer has been increased, leading
to better configurability of log output (8968), and parameter sources
(9258).

Support for CORBA Policy management, including Domain policy management.
A domain policy manager can be specified using configuration variable
policy_domain_manager in section [corba].

idlac now returns an exit status of 2 in the case of an illegal
IDL specification. (9213)

idlac now supports typeid declarations. (9212)

Some inefficiencies in the buffer management subsystem have been fixed,
giving a major improvement in performances when large data is passed
in request parameters.

Update of the implementation of the CORBA Interface Repository,
PortableInterceptors API.

Update of idlac to support IDL as defined by CORBA 3.0 standards.

Update all CORBA IDL specification to match latest release by the
OMG.

Implementation of the CORBA COS Notification Service (beta stage)
(9121), the RTCosScheduling service (RT-CORBA 1.1) (9016),

Several additions to the User's Guide.

Incompatible changes
--------------------

The implementation of CORBA POA's servant managers has been corrected
to match the IDL-to-Ada specifications, resulting in changes in the
API. (9322)

PolyORB.ORB_Controller.Basic has been renamed and is now
PolyORB.ORB_Controller.Workers. (9243)

idlac does not generate Interface Repository code by default anymore.
The '-ir' command line switch can be used to specifically request IR
code generation. The '-noir' command line switch is now a no-op and
will be removed in a future release. (9211)

idlac is now quiet by default. The '-v' command line switch can be used
to make it verbose. The '-q' command line switch is now a no-op and will
be removed in a future release. (9210)

The runtime configuration parameters that control the references
to well-known services (naming and interface repository) now support
corbaloc URIs as a possible notation (in addition to IORs). Consequently,
they have been renamed as follows:
  * In section [corba]:
    naming_ior -> name_service
    ir_ior     -> ir_service
  * In section [dsa]:
    naming_ior -> name_service
(9160)

Fixed bugs
----------

Fixes for several code generation issues in idlac, the IDL-to-Ada
compiler.

Fixes for memory leaks in GIOP code sets negotiation. (9228)

* PolyORB 1.2r (released 2004-12-17)
====================================

This release contains a CORBA-compatible instantiation of the PolyORB
generic middleware. In addition to the 1.1r release, it includes:
- extended support for CORBA and GIOP specifications,
- support for PortableInterceptors,
- support for RT-CORBA 1.1,
- fixes for several bugs and memory leaks,
- several additions to the User's Guide.

PolyORB now includes the Message Oriented Middleware for Ada (MOMA)
personality. It proposes an API comparable to Sun's Java Message
Service (JMS). It supports Publish/Subscribe and Point-to-Point.

PolyORB neutral core middleware now supports more concurrency
policies. It implements the No Tasking, Basic, Leader/Followers and
Half Sync/Half Async design patterns.

Release branched on 2004-12-17. (8922)

* PolyORB 1.1r (released 2004-06-07)
====================================

This release contains a CORBA-compatible instantiation of the PolyORB
generic middleware. In addition to the 1.0 release, it includes:
- a significant increase in performance (30%-40%),
- fixes for several bugs and memory leaks,
- extended support for CORBA and GIOP specifications,
- the PolyORB User's Guide,
- the MIOP/UIPMC protocol stack, Unreliable Multicast Inter-ORB Protocol,
  following the OMG standard,
- the DIOP protocol stack, Datagram-based Inter-ORB Protocol, a
  specialization of GIOP for oneway requests.

* PolyORB 1.0 (released 2003-06-16)
===================================

This release contains a CORBA-compliant instantiation of the PolyORB
generic middleware. It includes:
- an IDL to Ada 95 compiler,
- Portable Object Adapter (POA),
Dynamic Skeleton Interface (DSI),
Dynamic Invocation Interface (DII), and
Interface Repository (IR) implementations,
- COS Naming, COS Event and COS Time services implementations,
- GIOP 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 implementations.

This CORBA implementation can be configured for full tasking,
Ravenscar tasking or no tasking runtime, depending on the level
of desired functionality for the application, and on the resource
constraints for the target.

This release should be considered as a stable implementation of
CORBA middleware over PolyORB.

Release branched on 2003-05-16. (6783)

* PolyORB 0.1 (released 2001-12-04)
===================================

This is the first public release of PolyORB code. This release
contains the personality-neutral middleware core, the CORBA
application personality (including our IDL -> Ada 95 compiler idlac),
and CORBA and SOAP protocol personalities.  This should be considered
as test-phase software.
