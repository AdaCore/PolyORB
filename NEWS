* PolyORB 1.4 (not released yet)
================================

* PolyORB 1.3 (FROZEN, not released yet)
========================================

This release contains a CORBA-compatible instantiation of the PolyORB
generic middleware. In addition to the 1.2r release, it includes:

New features
------------

The modularity of the Neutral Core Layer has been increased, leading
to better configurability of log output (8968), and parameter sources
(9258).

Base support for the DynamicAny interface. (9282)

Support for CORBA Policy management, including Domain policy management.
A domain policy manager can be specified using configuration variable
policy_domain_manager in section [corba].

idlac now returns an exit status of 2 in the case of an illegal
IDL specification. (9213)

idlac now supports typeid declarations. (9212)

Some inefficiencies in the buffer management subsystem have been fixed,
giving a major improvement in performances when large data is passed
in request parameters.

Update of the implementation of the CORBA Interface Repository,
PortableInterceptors API.

Update of idlac to support IDL as defined by CORBA 3.0 standards.

Update all CORBA IDL specification to match latest release by the
OMG.

Implementation of the CORBA COS Notification Service (beta stage)
(9121), the RTCosScheduling service (RT-CORBA 1.1) (9016),

Several additions to the User's Guide.

Incompatible changes
--------------------

The implementation of CORBA POA's servant managers has been corrected
to match the IDL-to-Ada specifications, resulting in changes in the
API. (9322)

PolyORB.ORB_Controller.Basic has been renamed and is now
PolyORB.ORB_Controller.Workers. (9243)

idlac does not generate Interface Repository code by default anymore.
The '-ir' command line switch can be used to specifically request IR
code generation. The '-noir' command line switch is now a no-op and
will be removed in a future release. (9211)

idlac is now quiet by default. The '-v' command line switch can be used
to make it verbose. The '-q' command line switch is now a no-op and will
be removed in a future release. (9210)

The runtime configuration parameters that control the references
to well-known services (naming and interface repository) now support
corbaloc URIs as a possible notation (in addition to IORs). Consequently,
they have been renamed as follows:
  * In section [corba]:
    naming_ior -> name_service
    ir_ior     -> ir_service
  * In section [dsa]:
    naming_ior -> name_service
(9160)

Fixed bugs
----------

Fixes for several code generation issues in idlac, the IDL-to-Ada
compiler.

Fixes for memory leaks in GIOP code sets negotiation. (9228)

* PolyORB 1.2r (released 2004-12-17)
====================================

This release contains a CORBA-compatible instantiation of the PolyORB
generic middleware. In addition to the 1.1r release, it includes:
- extended support for CORBA and GIOP specifications,
- support for PortableInterceptors,
- support for RT-CORBA 1.1,
- fixes for several bugs and memory leaks,
- several additions to the User's Guide.

PolyORB now includes the Message Oriented Middleware for Ada (MOMA)
personality. It proposes an API comparable to Sun's Java Message
Service (JMS). It supports Publish/Subscribe and Point-to-Point.

PolyORB neutral core middleware now supports more concurrency
policies. It implements the No Tasking, Basic, Leader/Followers and
Half Sync/Half Async design patterns.

Release branched on 2004-12-17. (8922)

* PolyORB 1.1r (released 2004-06-07)
====================================

This release contains a CORBA-compatible instantiation of the PolyORB
generic middleware. In addition to the 1.0 release, it includes:
- a significant increase in performance (30%-40%),
- fixes for several bugs and memory leaks,
- extended support for CORBA and GIOP specifications,
- the PolyORB User's Guide,
- the MIOP/UIPMC protocol stack, Unreliable Multicast Inter-ORB Protocol,
  following the OMG standard,
- the DIOP protocol stack, Datagram-based Inter-ORB Protocol, a
  specialization of GIOP for oneway requests.

* PolyORB 1.0 (released 2003-06-16)
===================================

This release contains a CORBA-compliant instantiation of the PolyORB
generic middleware. It includes:
- an IDL to Ada 95 compiler,
- Portable Object Adapter (POA),
Dynamic Skeleton Interface (DSI),
Dynamic Invocation Interface (DII), and
Interface Repository (IR) implementations,
- COS Naming, COS Event and COS Time services implementations,
- GIOP 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 implementations.

This CORBA implementation can be configured for full tasking,
Ravenscar tasking or no tasking runtime, depending on the level
of desired functionality for the application, and on the resource
constraints for the target.

This release should be considered as a stable implementation of
CORBA middleware over PolyORB.

Release branched on 2003-05-16. (6783)

* PolyORB 0.1 (released 2001-12-04)
===================================

This is the first public release of PolyORB code. This release
contains the personality-neutral middleware core, the CORBA
application personality (including our IDL -> Ada 95 compiler idlac),
and CORBA and SOAP protocol personalities.  This should be considered
as test-phase software.
