--------------

New features in version 1.0pre3
===============================

COS Naming and COS Events are implemented. A stand-alone name server,
ab_names, is provided.

UNIX manual pages are provided.

Some support for Dynamic Invocation Interface, Interface Repository and
valuetypes.

A shell-script ab_gnome lets you use GNOME name service (as well as others)
from AdaBroker.

A package Broca.Parameters allows the person installing AdaBroker to
change the default stack size in server tasks.

Bugs fixed include:
  Usage of a constant as the length of an array is now
  correctly supported.
  An expansion problem with some instances of sequences in interface
  declarations has been corrected.
  (Problems reported by Xavier Montet of CENA).

  The handling of escaped keywords as identifiers was fixed.
  (Problem reported by Mehtap Kologlu of Eurocontrol).

  Unknown profiles in IORs are now processed correctly.
  (Problem noted while interoperating with ORBit).

  Unknown exceptions are now correctly map to the UNKNOWN
  system exception.

Incompatible changes in version 1.0pre3
=======================================

The declaration of the Is_A operation on CORBA.Object was put in
conformity with the standard Ada mapping: the Logical_Type_Id argument
is a Standard.String.

New features in version 1.0pre2
===============================

New command line switch: '-p', output all generated
packages concatenated on standard output (in a form
suitable for gnatchop).

Support for fixed-point data types.
Support for IDL identifiers that conflict with Ada keywords.

Several bug fixes.

Incompatible changes in version 1.0pre2
=======================================

When invoking idlac with the '-i' command line switch
to generate an implementation template, only the implementation
template (and not the stubs, skeletons and streams packages)
is produced.

New features in version 1.0pre1
===============================

A new IDL to Ada compiler, idlac, written entirely
in Ada 95. No more C++ code, and no need for the
Sun IDL front-end. The build process is now
automated using GNU Automake/Autoconf.

New features in version 0.9
===========================

The omniORB library has been completely replaced by
an ORB written in Ada, Broca. The only remaining
omniORB part in AdaBroker is the IDL compiler
front-end (from Sun) and the target-independent
layer of the back-end (from omniORB).
