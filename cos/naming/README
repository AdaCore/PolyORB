README for PolyORB Naming Service
----------------------------------

$Id$

PolyORB provides two implementations of a Naming Service :

ab_names : It is an implementation of the CORBA COS Naming built
	   on top of the CORBA personality. It is compliant to
	   OMG's specifications.

po_names : It provides an interface similar to CORBA COS Naming,
	   without any dependencies on CORBA. It is useful to
           provide naming functionnalities to DSA or MOMA
	   applications.

ir_ab_names : XXX to be written

test_naming : provide a shell to test ab_names.

test_naming_generic : test programs to interact either with ab_names or 
test_naming_corba     po_names.
