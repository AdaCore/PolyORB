The project files in this directory are for building PolyORB.
See ../projects-distrib for building clients of PolyORB.

common.gpr -- imported by all the others; contains commonly used variables

config.gpr -- generated from config.gpr.in by configure, and imported by common.gpr.

build_all.gpr -- imports all the others; can be used to recompile everything,
using the -U switch of gnatmake.  (??Currently not used.)

One for each of the following directories:

  src and its subdirectories (including src_setup.gpr, which is generated from
  src_setup.gpr.in).

  subdirectories of cos

  subdirectories of idls that correspond to subdirectories of cos

The naming convention is the path name, relative to the root of
the polyorb hierarchy, with directory separators "/" replaced
with underscore "_"; for example, src_giop_diop.gpr is the project
file for src/giop/diop.
Each of these builds a library.

tools_*.gpr -- these are for building programs.
