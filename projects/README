We have the following project files:

common.gpr -- imported by all the others; contains commonly used variables

build_all.gpr -- imports all the others; can be used to recompile everything,
using the -U switch of gnatmake.

One for each of the following directories:
src and its subdirectories
subdirectories of cos
subdirectories of idls that correspond to subdirectories of cos
The naming convention is the path name, relative to the root of
the polyorb hierarchy, with directory separators "/" replaced
with underscore "_"; for example, src_giop_diop.gpr is the project
file for src/giop/diop.
Each of these builds a library, except for src_dsa.gpr.

cos_ir_mains.gpr cos_naming_mains.gpr -- these are for building programs
in cos/ir and cos/naming. This is necessary because project files cannot build
both libraries and main procedures.
