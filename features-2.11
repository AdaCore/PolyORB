NF-211-N923-009 Lifted limitations on IAC command line (2014-09-23)

  IAC used to support only 64 preprocessor arguments, and 64 search path
  elements at most. Both limitations have been removed.

NF-211-N906-002 Changed preference order for Ada compiler (2014-09-06)

  When looking for an Ada compiler, the PolyORB configure scripts now
  favor "gcc" over "gnatgcc" or "adagcc". The default Ada compiler can
  always be overridden at configure time using the "ADA" environment
  variable.

NF-211-N109-057 Use standard initial reference for name service (2014-01-13)

  PolyORB.CORBA_P.Naming_Tools now first looks up the name server using the
  standard "NameService" initial reference key. The legcay implementation
  defined "NamingService" key is used as a fallback.
