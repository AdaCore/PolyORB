The following is a listing of known problems in release 2.9. Except where
specifically noted, all these problems have been corrected in the final
release of the 2.10 technology. This means they are corrected in release
2.10 and in any wavefront issued subsequent to the date specified (in
ISO format YYYY-MM-DD) in the status line. This can be used to determine
if a given wavefront has the fix identified in the entry.

KP-291-M313-015 Unsafe concurrent RCI lookups

  Problem:    When concurrent tasks attempt to retrieve the base reference
              for a remote RCI unit, incorrect coordination and unsafe
              concurrent accesses to shared data can cause spurious lookup
              failures to be reported to application code.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.10 on 2013-03-14

  Workaround: Guard RCI calls with handlers for System.RPC.Communication_Error
              and retry failed calls.

KP-291-M308-031 Application with tasking hands in remote call

  Problem:    If a partition has tasking, then in rare cases a race condition
              may cause a remote call to hang indefinitely.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.10 on 2013-03-08
              This was fixed in 2.9.2 on 2013-05-28

  Workaround: Use a select statement with asynchronous transfer of control
              to protect remote calls with a timeout.

KP-291-M308-030 Application with Ada starter hangs

  Problem:    The network access points opened by the main partition were
              incorrectly inherited by slave partitions when using an Ada
              starter, causing the slave partitions to fail to connect to
              the master partition, depending on which partition would
              receive the incoming connection notification.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.10 on 2013-03-06
              This was fixed in 2.9.2 on 2013-05-28

  Workaround: Do not use an Ada starter.
