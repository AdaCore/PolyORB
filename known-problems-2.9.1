KP-291-IB11-005 Application with Ada starter hangs

  Problem:    The network access points opened by the main partition were
              incorrectly inherited by slave partitions when using an Ada
              starter, causing the slave partitions to fail to connect to
              the master partition, depending on which partition would
              receive the incoming connection notification.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.10 on 2013-03-06

  Workaround: Do not use an Ada starter.
