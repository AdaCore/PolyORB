=============================

Copyright (C) 2009-2010, AdaCore

This file contains a complete list of new features in version 2.7 of PolyORB.
See also file NEWS for various information about this release.

An ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) appears in parentheses after the description line.
This date shows the implementation date of the feature. Any 2.7 wavefront
subsequent to this date will contain the indicated feature, as will any
subsequent releases.

NF-27-J817-001 Abortable RPC (2010-09-03)

   Remote subprogram calls can now safely be aborted using asynchronous
   transfer of control. The abortion is notified to the server, and an attempt
   is made to cancel the server side execution of the call.

NF-27-J723-021 Time stamps in traces (2010-07-28)

   Time stamps can now optionally be generated for trace messages logged
   to standard error. This feature is enabled by setting "timestamp=true"
   in section [log] of the PolyORB configuration.

NF-27-J521-019 DSA starter does not depend on Bourne shell (2010-08-31)

   The generated Ada and shell starters for DSA applications do not require
   the remote node to provide a Bourne shell anymore.

NF-27-J511-001 po_gnatdist reports Name_Server setting (2010-05-12)

   If a pragma Name_Server is given in the configuration file, po_gnatdist
   reports this information in its output.

NF-27-J317-029 Better selection of local IP address (2010-04-27)

   PolyORB now tries to avoid using a loopback address when creating
   profiles designating local listening sockets, so that the generated IORs
   or URLs are valid beyond the local host.

NF-27-J225-018 Allow CORBA.Any to be used at library level (2010-02-27)

   Objects of CORBA.Any type can be declared at library level now, and
   be elaborated before initialization of ORB.

NF-27-J118-027 Use minimal perfect hash functions (2010-03-11)

   The Ada code generated by iac now uses minimal perfect hash functions rather
   than cascading 'if' statements in the Skel. This is a speed improvement,
   especially when there are a large number of methods.

NF-27-IC22-022 Disable style checks in po_gnatdist generated files (2009-12-23)

   Style checks are now turned off for source files generated by po_gnatdist
   to avoid spurious messages if user enables such checks from the command
   line using -gnaty.

NF-27-IC17-020 Allow child library procedure as partition mains (2010-01-13)

   A child library procedure can now be used as the main subprogram of a
   partition (this was not previously supported).

NF-27-IC17-019 Renamed PolyORB project files (2009-12-17)

   The project files distributed with PolyORB have been renamed to include
   a "polyorb_" prefix, to avoid clashes with user project files.

NF-27-IB23-017 Embedded name server for DSA applications (2009-12-04)

   A small embedded name server can be optionally integrated in the main
   partition of a DSA application, to remove the requirement for a separate
   name server. This is achieved using pragma Name_Server (Embedded).
   Note that this currently also requires pragma Starter (Ada).

NF-27-IA16-043 Use atomic builtins for reference counting (2009-11-13)

   Atomic increment and decrement operations are now used for reference
   counting within the PolyORB runtime, instead of mutex-protected counters,
   on platforms where such operations are supported by GCC. This affords
   improved performances when using tasking on these platforms.
