Copyright (C) 2009-2010, AdaCore

This file contains a complete list of new features in version 2.5 of PolyORB.
See also file NEWS for various information about this release.

An ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) appears in parentheses after the description line.
This date shows the implementation date of the feature. Any 2.6w wavefront
subsequent to this date will contain the indicated feature, as will any
subsequent releases.

NF-27-IC22-022 Disable style checks in po_gnatdist generated files (2009-12-23)

   Style checks are now turned off for source files generated by po_gnatdist
   to avoid spurious messages if user enables such checks from the command
   line using -gnaty.

NF-27-IC17-020 Allow child library procedure as partition mains (2010-01-13)

   A child library procedure can now be used as the main subprogram of a
   partition (this was not previously supported).

NF-27-IC17-019 Renamed PolyORB project files (2009-12-17)

   The project files distributed with PolyORB have been renamed to include
   a "polyorb_" prefix, to avoid clashes with user project files.

NF-27-IB23-017 Embedded name server for DSA applications (2009-12-04)

   A small embedded name server can be optionally integrated in the main
   partition of a DSA application, to remove the requirement for a separate
   name server. This is achieved using pragma Name_Server (Embedded).
   Note that this currently also requires pragma Starter (Ada).

NF-27-IA16-043 Use atomic builtins for reference counting (2009-11-13)

   Atomic increment and decrement operations are now used for reference
   counting within the PolyORB runtime, instead of mutex-protected counters,
   on platforms where such operations are supported by GCC. This affords
   improved performances when using tasking on these platforms.
