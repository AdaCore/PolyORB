NF-27-IB23-017 Embedded name server for DSA applications (2009-12-04)

   A small embedded name server can be optionally integrated in the main
   partition of a DSA application, to remove the requirement for a separate
   name server. This is achieved using pragma Name_Server (Embedded).
   Note that this currently also requires pragma Starter (Ada).

NF-27-IA16-043 Use atomic builtins for reference counting (2009-11-13)

   Atomic increment and decrement operations are now used for reference
   counting within the PolyORB runtime, instead of mutex-protected counters,
   on platforms where such operations are supported by GCC. This affords
   improved performances when using tasking on these platforms.
