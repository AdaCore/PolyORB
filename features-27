NF-27-IA16-043 Use atomic builtins for reference counting (2009-11-13)

   Atomic increment and decrement operations are now used for reference
   counting within the PolyORB runtime, instead of mutex-protected counters,
   on platforms where such operations are supported by GCC. This affords
   improved performances when using tasking on these platforms.
