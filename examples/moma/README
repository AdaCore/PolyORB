This demo displays first possibilities of MOMA.

The server setup one message pool according to data found in
'destinations.conf'. The only pertinent parameter is 'persistent' that
determine which persistence is to be used.

The client sends and receives messages to the message pool created.
MText and MBytes messages are tested.

To test persistence, you must setup a persistent destination, then

To run the test, without using a naming service :

- launch the server : ./server, it will outputs its IOR string.
- run the client to store messages : ./client stor pool <IOR>
- kill the server, then re-launch it
- run the client to retrieve messages : ./client retr pool <IOR>

To run the test, wusing a naming service :

- launch the server with the IOR string of the Naming Service : 
./server IOR:... , it will outputs its IOR string.
- run the client to store messages : ./client stor naming <IOR>
- kill the server, then re-launch it
- run the client to retrieve messages : ./client retr naming <IOR>
