README for the PolyORB MOMA example

This demo displays first possibilities of MOMA.

The server setups one message pool according to data found in
'destinations.conf'. The only pertinent parameter is 'persistent' that
determine which persistence is to be used.

The client sends and receives messages to the message pool created.
MText and MBytes messages are tested.

To test persistence, you must setup a persistent destination, then

To run the PTP test, without using a naming service :

- launch the server : ./server, it will output its IOR string.
- run the client to store messages : ./client stor pool <IOR>
- kill the server, then re-launch it
- run the client to retrieve messages : ./client retr pool <IOR>

To run the PTP test, using a naming service :

- launch the server with the IOR string of the Naming Service : 
./server IOR:... , it will output its IOR string.
- run the client to store messages : ./client stor naming <IOR>
- run the client to retrieve messages : ./client retr naming <IOR>

To run the Pub/Sub test (necessarily without a naming service) :

- edit destinations.conf to set persistency to none, as currently all pools
use the same filenames to store persistent messages
- launch n message pools (= servers) :
./server n times, it will output its IOR string IOR_Pk (k = 1..n)
- launch p routers :
./router r1, it will output its IOR string IOR_R1
./router rj IOR_R1, it will output its IOR string IOR_R2 (j = 2..p)
- subscribe some pools to the test topic using some routers :
./client sub IOR_Pk IOR_Rj, where k in 1..n, j in 1..p
- send once the test messages to the test topic :
./client stor topic IOR_Rj, where j in 1..p
- retrieve the test messages from any pool subscribed to the test topic :
./client retr pool IOR_Pk, where k in 1..n is the index of a subscribed pool
