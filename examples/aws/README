Examples using the AWS application personality
----------------------------------------------

client_web <uri>
client_soap <uri>

where <uri> MUST be an URI, as AWS only handles URIs. So entering an
IOR or a corbaloc will not work.

server instantiates two servants: 
- one for the classical web
- another for web services

Keep in mind that a web server only accepts a few method names (get,
post, etc.); so the web server will raise an exception if another
method is invoked. The soap server will accept any method name.
