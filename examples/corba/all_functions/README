This demo tests the processing for various argument passing modes, both
in the case where network communication is involved and in the case of
local calls.

Three executables are provided
- server : a CORBA server application, provides various functions that
  receive and return values.

- client : a CORBA client application, built to interact with 'server',
  test various combinations of argument modes

- dynclient : same, using the DII

* To run these tests :

1) client/server test :

- launch server
- launch client using the IOR string output by server as an argument

The client will interact with the server, doing several tests. The different
results are displayed on the client side.

2) local test :

- launch 'server local'
- the server runs the tests within the same partition
