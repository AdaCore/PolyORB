README for the PolyORB CORBA interoperability tests
---------------------------------------------------

$Id: //droopi/main/examples/corba/all_types/interop/java/README#2 $

* Compilation

edit the makefile to setup:

- Java SDK and JRE;

- Path to ORB jar files ...

* To run the tests

make run_dynserver
make run_dynclient

The object IOR is stored in the `IOR` file and read _from this file_
by DynClient.

Note: the IDL file has been modified to accomodate bug in compilation
process...
