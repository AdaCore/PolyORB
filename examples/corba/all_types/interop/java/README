README for the PolyORB CORBA interoperability tests
---------------------------------------------------

$Id: //droopi/main/examples/corba/all_types/interop/java/README#3 $

* Compatibility

PolyORB has been (partially) successfully tested with
 - OpenORB 1.3.0
 - Jonathan 3.0 alpha

* Compilation

To compile these examples, you need to edit the makefile to setup:
 - Java SDK and JRE;
 - Path to ORB jar files.

Currently, the sources only compile for Jonathan, compiling for
OpenORB requires little adaptation of implementation files.

* Run the tests

Type

make run_dynserver to run the DSI server;
make run_dynclient to run the DII client;
make run_server    to run the static server;
make run_client    to run the static client.


The object IOR is stored in the `IOR` file and read _from this file_
by clients.

* Compatibility note

- OpenORB: the IDL file has been modified to accomodate bug in
compilation process...

- Jonathan: the union Java code seems buggy.
