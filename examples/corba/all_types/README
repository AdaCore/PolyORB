README for the PolyORB all_types example

This demo tests marshalling unmarshalling functions.

Three executables are provided
- server : a CORBA server application, provides echo<types> functions
  where types are CORBA defined types.

- client : a CORBA client application, built to interact with 'server',
  test all CORBA types.

- client_moma : a MOMA client application, built to interact with 'server'.
  It tests string type. It is a demonstration of ORB/MOM interoperability.

* To run these tests :

1) client/server test :

- launch server
- launch client using the IOR string output by server as an argument

The client will interact with the server, doing several tests. The different
results are displayed on the client side.

2) client_moma/server test:

- launch 'server'
- launch a MOMA message_pool node, for example example/moma/server
- launch 'client_moma' using the IOR string output by the all_types server
   as first argument, IOR string output by MOMA message_pool node as second
   argument

Here is the demo scenario :
- 'client_moma' will first build a MExecute message
- 'client_moma' sends it to the server as an RPC
- 'server' will send the response back to 'client_moma'
- a call back component will bounce the response to the message_pool

If the MOMA node is set to persistent, the received messages will be stored
into different files.
