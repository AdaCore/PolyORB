About the "random" example
==========================

Random.org offers true random numbers to anyone on the internet.
If you want to know how the numbers are made and what it is that
makes them true, read the introduction to randomness and random numbers.

Among other means, these random numbers are made available to
the community through a CORBA object with a well-known IOR
(see file IOR in this directory). The random example contains
a client for this service, and also a server implementation
that implements the same interface.

Beware however that, unlike random.org's numbers, the numbers
generated by the AdaBroker server implementation are /not/ truly
random in any sense. Random.org carefully craft their numbers using
real entropy generators, while we simply use the Ada runtime to
generate a pseudo-random sequence.
