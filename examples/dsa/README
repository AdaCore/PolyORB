Systems Annex:

- echo

- bank
  A client/server application with one server and multiple instances of the
  client partition

- connections
  Multiple servers and multiple clients, each server has a single
  receiving task and blocks waiting for clients; clients use asynchronous
  send operations

  Same as "connections" but implemented in Ada 2005 using an RACW with
  designating an interface implemented by the server task.
