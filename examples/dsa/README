This directory contains the following examples for the Ada Distributed
Systems Annex:

- echo
  Simple client/server ping

- demo
  Demo of passing complex data types between client and server

- connections
  Multiple servers and multiple clients, each server has a single
  receiving task and blocks waiting for clients; clients use asynchronous
  send operations

- mailboxes
  Same as "connections" but implemented in Ada 2005 using an RACW with
  designating an interface implemented by the server task.
