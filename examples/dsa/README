To run this demo, you need to:

1. Run a CORBA COS Naming server, for example PolyORB's  'po_cos_naming'
   located in the cos/naming directory.

2. Set the POLYORB_DSA_NAME_SERVICE environment variable to the IOR or URL of
   the naming context of the COS Naming server in which DSA packages shall
   be registered.

3. If you want to use the termination manager, you must set either the client, or the
   server as the termination initiator. 
    o Copy the binary 'server' OR the binary 'client' to a separate location.
    o Copy the file src/polyorb.conf to this location.
    o Set to true the parameter [dsa]termination_initiator 

4. Then, run 'server' and 'client' programs.
