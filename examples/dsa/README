To run this demo without gnatdist, you need to:

1. run a CORBA COS Naming server, for example PolyORB's  'po_cos_naming'
  located in the cos/naming directory.

2. set the POLYORB_DSA_NAMING_IOR environment variable to the IOR of the
   naming context of the COS Naming server in which DSA packages shall
   be registered.

3. then run 'server' and 'client' programs.
