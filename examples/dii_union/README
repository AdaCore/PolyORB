This program tests the management of unions id DII.
The server modifies the union that it receives and send it back.
The correct output for the dii_client as it is should be:
<< sw = 1, counter =  2706
You can modify the argument of the 'modify' request in the dii_client to
check the different possibilities (see also the actual implementation of
'modify' in modifier-impl.adb.
