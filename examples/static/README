README for the static configuration examples directory
------------------------------------------------------

$Id$

This directory contains a sample static configuration file named
'po_static_conf.ads'. To test this configuration method, just
copy this file to another PolyORB example, for example the CORBA
echo test:

   $ cp po_static_conf.ads ../corba/echo/

Then, go to that directory

   $ cd ../corba/echo/

and execute:

   $ idlac echo.idl
   $ gnatmake -c po_static_conf.ads `polyorb-config`
   $ gnatmake server `polyorb-config` -largs po_static_conf.o

You can then edit the file 'po_static_conf.ads' to modify some
PolyORB parameter of the executable. After that you must compile again
that configuration file:

   $ gnatmake -c po_static_conf.ads `polyorb-config`

and then just relink the application without recompiling any application
sources:

   $ gnatmake -l server `polyorb-config` -largs po_static_conf.o

Note that you must also specify the option -b to rebind the application
because the file 'b~server.ali' is required for relinking, but it is
usually removed by gnatmake after the compilation.
