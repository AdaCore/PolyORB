Thu Nov 28 22:33:30 1996  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-rpc.adb: Handle task non-abortion (which is quite frequent :-)
	more elegantly than before. It also corrects a strange
	segmentation fault in GNAT runtime which appeared only when
	debugging was off (that is a fast succession of events, probably a
	race condition in protected objects and entry family handling).
	
Wed Nov 27 18:42:47 1996  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-stratt.adb: Added pragma Suppress for range and overflow
	  checks.

	* s-gaseli.adb: Changed the protocol to make it simpler.
	  Changed this stupid protocol one more time.

Tue Nov 26 15:52:33 1996  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-ganobl.adb: Changed the safety delay to be 0.5 seconds.

Sat Nov 23 16:57:56 1996  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-gartcp.adb: Added missing constant.

Thu Nov 21 19:45:25 1996  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-gartcp.adb: Protect against very early internal error which
	  could propagate even when it's not fatal.

	* s-rpc.adb: Do not wait on protected entry in a finalization
	  procedure called during abortion. A flag showing that the result
	  will have to be invalidated when it arrives is set instead, thus
	  providing a much better respect of the semantic of abort (abort
	  very quickly) instead of waiting for the answer. If the answer
	  was there already, it's discarded.

Tue Nov 19 16:56:07 1996  Laurent Pautet  <pautet@quasimodo.enst.fr>

	* s-garela.adb: New package provided to set usual defaults.

	* s-garopt.adb: Add Set_[...] (Default : [...]) corresponding to

	[...].Initialize.

	* s-garnam.adb: Idem.

	* constants.sh (constants): Removed useless constants.

	* Makefile.am: No need for special
	  dependencies with the new mkdep in fact, provided that the

	* Makefile.am: Added s-gaosli.*.

Mon Sep 30 16:13:29 1996  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

Sun Sep 15 17:27:30 1996  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-garhea.adb: Added an Emergency_Stop in the Shutdown procedure
	  (see the procedure for explanation).

Thu Sep 12 14:55:27 1996  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* mkdep: Change the way dependencies are generated. This one seems
	  to be the good one.

	* s-garter.adb: Don't check Get_Active_Task_Count during the

	  termination.

	* s-stratt.ads: Added.

	* s-rpc.ads: Removed the offending declaration.

	* s-rpc.adb: Allow mixed Read and Write calls. Allocate Node

Mon Aug 12 16:13:54 1996  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>
