	  Roy T. Fielding concerning possible incorrect address resolution 
	  in presence of hostnames beginning by a digit.

Tue Sep  2 21:51:34 1997  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-garrem.ads: Added an Exchange_Launcher procedure as well as a
	  Local_Launcher. Exported Rsh_Launcher in the spec.

	* s-garrem.adb: Implemented what is described below.

Fri Aug 29 20:58:30 1997  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-rpcpoo.adb: Use new flag to avoid starting the whole runtime
	  when a partition has no RCI receiver and no RACW.

Fri Aug 29 20:17:26 1997  Laurent Pautet  <pautet@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-garopt.ads: Add a new flag Has_RCI_Pkg_Or_RACW_Var (default is
	true). This flag is set to false when no RCI is configured on this
	partition and when no RACW can possibly be declared.

Thu Aug 28 19:16:46 1997  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* Makefile.am (GNATFLAGS): Removed -gnatdj.

Wed Aug 13 16:11:03 1997  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-gartra.adb: Remove the length of each entry from the trace
	  file since using 'Output and 'Input instead of 'Write and 'Read
	  will make this automatically.

Tue Aug 12 13:08:31 1997  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* Makefile.am: Use libtool to compile files and generate shared
	  library as well. Extract duplicate symbols from libgnat.a.

Fri Jun  6 15:30:43 1997  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-stratt.adb: Changed 2**8 - 1 into 16#FF# to prevent
	  (letigimate) error on VMS.

Wed Jun  4 18:00:57 1997  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-gafizi.adb: Replaced pragma Elaborate by pragma Elaborate_All
	  since it makes no sense to elaborate only one of the needed
	  packages.

Thu May 29 17:30:14 1997  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-rpcpoo.adb: Do not start handling a request until elaboration
	is terminated.

	* s-rpstio.ads: New procedure Initialize.

	* s-rpstio.adb: New procedure Initialize to avoid doing suspect
	things at elaboration time. Removed the Elaborate_All clauses.

	* s-rpcini.adb: Added call to Initialize procedure of Stream_IO.

Wed May  7 15:00:33 1997  Laurent Pautet  <pautet@scapin.enst.fr>

	* s-garsta.adb: Renum phases.

	* s-garlic.ads: Added comments about additional phases.

	* s-garsta.adb: Removed useless with and elaborate_all clauses.

Mon May  5 21:32:28 1997  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-garter.ads: Elaborate body as soon as possible because of the
	  possible use of the protected type from outside.

Sat May  3 16:14:27 1997  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* Makefile.in: Added split to CLEANFILES.

	* split.adb: Use System.IO rather than Ada.Text_IO to avoid
	  problems with Ada.Text_IO depending on s-stratt.adb.

Fri May  2 16:40:02 1997  Samuel Tardieu <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* Makefile.am: Use the split utility

	* Makefile.am (install-data-local): Changed sed into $(SED)

Fri May  2 16:37:16 1997  Daniel Neri  <d92-dne@nada.kth.se>

	* constants.sh: Allow for very long ``uname -a'' lines which cause
 	GNAT's style checks to barf on s-garcon.ads. The uname output is
 	now wrapped with ``fmt'' (which hopefully is present on all
 	important Unices).

Wed Apr 30 15:32:43 1997  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-garpri.ads: Added background creation priority.

	* s-rpcpoo.adb: Added task pool. Low-priority background
	  pre-allocation, reuse of tasks and destruction are implemented.

	* s-rpc.adb: Enclose two potentially blocking operations with
	  pragma Warnings to avoid warning.

	* s-rpcpoo.ads: New routine Allocate_Task to enforce the pool
	  abstraction.

	* s-rpc.adb: Splitted System.RPC into 3 packages (System.RPC,
	  System.RPC.Pool and System.RPC.Util). Do not use Anonymous_Task
	  directly.

Wed Apr 23 11:36:04 1997  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* Makefile.am (install-data-local): Make installed source read-only
	to anticipate gnatmake changes (right fix in the right place).

Tue Apr 22 17:44:25 1997  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* Makefile.in (install-data-local): Make installed sources
	  read-only to anticipate gnatmake changes.

Mon Apr  7 12:46:42 1997  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* Makefile.zip: The previous one was totally uncompatible with
	  VPATH handling.

	* Makefile.am: Do not destroy the target directory before building
	  the objects.

	* constants.sh: Output aligned constants & use hexa instead of
	  decimal.

Wed Mar 26 23:07:31 1997  Laurent Pautet  <pautet@esmeralda.enst.fr>

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in: Add s-garrep and s-gartra in
 	COMMON_OBJECTS and COMMON_SOURCES. Rebuild source
 	dependencies. Tag to_be_released.

	* zlib: Add zlib dir and tag to_be_released. Warning: Need for
	a target 'distclean' and 'clean' in zlib Makefile and also a call
	to this target in Garlic Makefile.

Mon Mar 24 15:44:31 1997  Laurent Pautet  <pautet@scapin.enst.fr>

	* s-gartcp.adb: Modified Open_Code, Data_Code and Quit_Code to be
	indianess independant.

	* Makefile.am: Updated for automake 1.1m.

Mon Mar 17 15:30:14 1997  Laurent Pautet  <pautet@scapin.enst.fr>

	* s-stratt.adb: Incorrect check for W_*F. U was not always equal
 	to 0 because the first byte has a special treatment.

Wed Mar 12 13:53:10 1997  Laurent Pautet  <pautet@scapin.enst.fr>

	* Makefile.am: s-garela.o was missing. Not detected before because
	of a bug in gnatmake. 

	* mkdep: Missing space.

Sat Mar  8 16:48:38 1997  Laurent Pautet  <pautet@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-garrem.adb: Add -n to rsh. It won't break anything and at
	least, it may avoid dup2 to fail.

Fri Mar  7 14:14:46 1997  Laurent Pautet  <pautet@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-garrem.adb, s-garrem.ads: Add a parameter Launcher to most of
 	the launching commands in order to change default "rsh" command
 	which was hardcoded.

	* s-garfil.ads: Add pragma Elaborate_Body to please GNAT with its
 	new elaboration checks.

Wed Mar  5 14:53:58 1997  Laurent Pautet  <pautet@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-garhea.ads: Add a new opcode User_Message.

	* s-parint.adb: Changed Public_RPC_Receiver into
 	Public_Message_Receiver.

Wed Mar  5 14:19:51 1997  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-gartcp.adb: Added missing pragma Elaborate_All (new checks in
	  today's wavefront).

	* s-gardeb.adb: Idem.

	* s-garsta.adb: Idem.

	* s-garter.adb: Idem.

	* s-stratt.adb: Renames Unchecked_Conversion into
	  Ada.Unchecked_Conversion. Comment out assertions because the
	  current package may not depend on System.Assertions because of
	  categorization pragma.

Fri Feb 28 16:45:36 1997  Laurent Pautet  <pautet@lglsun11.epfl.ch>

	* s-garfil.ads, s-garfil.adb, s-gafino.adb: Move decalration of
 	No_Fitler_name into System.Garlic.Filters private part.

Thu Feb 27 11:13:51 1997  Laurent Pautet  <pautet@lglsun11.epfl.ch>

	* s-gafino.adb: Change Dummy_Name from "" to "none".

	* s-garfil.adb, s-garfil.ads, s-gafino.adb: Change
 	Set_Register_Filter into Set_Registration_Filter and add several
 	default behaviour.

Wed Feb 26 11:28:07 1997  Laurent Pautet  <pautet@lglsun11.epfl.ch>

	* Makefile.am: Reduce the effort of a third party to add a new
 	filter. Clear almost everything that was dedicated to filters and
 	add @FILTERFILE@ which indicates where to include global filter
 	makefile.

	* Makefile.am: Forgot to copy ada files sources and objects.

Mon Feb 24 12:54:55 1997  Laurent Pautet  <pautet@lglsun11.epfl.ch>

	* s-garhea.ads: Add a new procedure Initialize.

	* s-garhea.adb: Set Opcode size right from the beginning. This is
 	used to avoid unnecessary buffer copies.

	* s-garfil.adb: Use the previous knowledge to reduce unnecessary
 	buffer copies.

Fri Feb 21 19:53:29 1997  Laurent Pautet  <pautet@quasimodo.enst.fr>

	* Makefile.am: Add zip filtering. Z library is now included in the
        release. By default, it is not installed but with
	--with-filters="zip", the Z library is included in garlic
	library and Z binding and filter are also included.
	

Fri Feb 21 17:35:34 1997  Laurent Pautet  <pautet@lglsun11.epfl.ch>

	* s-gafizi.adb, s-gafizi.ads: Add zip filtering.

	* s-garhea.adb, s-garfil.adb, s-garfil.ads: Optimization of buffer
 	copies.

Thu Feb 20 14:45:29 1997  Laurent Pautet  <pautet@lglsun11.epfl.ch>

	* s-garfil.ads, s-garfil.adb, s-gafino.ads, s-gafino.adb: Add
 	filtering. Only filter None has been included.
	
	* s-garsta.adb: Add filtering packages elaboration and call
 	System.Garlic.Filters.Initialize.

	* s-garhea.adb: Set filtering hooks in Send and Data_Arrived.
	This is a draft. Need to avoid copy optimization.
	
Thu Feb 13 19:35:41 1997  Laurent Pautet  <pautet@lglsun11.epfl.ch>

	* s-garter.adb: Add a new procedure Local_Termination to provide
 	local termination facilities offered by Termination attribute
 	(newly defined in Gnatdist). Wait for Get_Active_Task_Count to be
 	1.

	* s-garopt.ads, s-garopt.adb: Move Permanent into Termination.
  	Permanent = True is equivalent to Termination = Deferred.  To
 	specify on the command line, use --terminate <local, global,
 	deferred>.

	* s-garhea.ads : Add type Termination_Type.
	
Thu Feb 13 09:02:25 1997  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-garhea.ads: New function to check for termination.

	* s-garhea.adb: Ditto.

	* s-gartcp.adb: Protect block to prevent a race condition during
	  termination (see comment). This may or may not fix the problem,
	  anyway this is not blocking for the release.

	* Makefile.am: Don't compile s-ganobl.ad[bs] when not needed.

	* 2wgarcon.ads: New file containing precomputed Windows constants
	  (due to a bug in Cygnus' <sys/socket.h>, this file cannot be
	  generated automatically without patching the header file).

Wed Feb 12 11:52:46 1997  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-parint.ads: Reinstalled the kludge.

Tue Feb 11 14:17:44 1997  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-gartcp.adb: (Port_To_Network): New function.
	  (Network_To_Port): New function.
	  Use these two functions each time a port number is copied to or
	  from a sin_* structure.

Mon Feb 10 15:11:20 1997  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* 2xgtplsp.ads: New (untested) SNI version of this package.

	* 2wgtplsp.ads: New (untested) Win32 version of this package.

	* test_threads.adb: New file which tries to determine if 
	  thread-blocking IOs are available on the current target.

Fri Feb  7 17:29:15 1997  Laurent Pautet  <pautet@lglsun11.epfl.ch>

	* s-parint.ads: Force body elaboration. Workaround to be removed
 	as soon as elaboration of generic package instanciation is fixed.

Fri Feb  7 11:35:42 1997  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* constants.sh: Added O_RDONLY and O_WRONLY to the list of
	  constants.

	* s-garrem.adb: Avoid using dup2() because of a bug in Linux
	  threads library handling of this call along with non-overloaded
	  functions: MIT pthreads library use an internal file table which
	  is mapped on the process file table. When dup2() is used, the
	  pthreads library doesn't really call the dup2 system call but
	  use its mapping table to replace calls to the new descriptor by
	  calls to the old one; before this, it closes the new descriptor
	  if it was already opened to preserve dup2() semantics. When
	  another system call such as getsockname() is used and is not
	  overloaded by the pthreads library, then the file descriptor
	  passed to the kernel is the one seen by the application, that is
	  the one assigned by the threads library, which do *NOT*
	  correspond (because of the close() performed to simulate dup2())
	  to the one assigned by the kernel itself. This causes such
	  operations to fail with EBADF (bad file descriptor).

Thu Feb  6 17:51:34 1997  Laurent Pautet  <pautet@lglsun11.epfl.ch>

	* s-parint.adb: More comments. Suppress
 	Public_Receiver_Is_Installed because never used.

Thu Feb  6 16:45:34 1997  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* constants.sh: Replaced gnatk8 by gnatkr.

Wed Feb  5 18:58:18 1997  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-gartcp.adb: Removed every ATC in the TCP module by using 4
	  characters operation codes which will unblock all the peers if
	  needed after shutdown synchronization.

Tue Feb  4 14:56:48 1997  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-gartcp.adb: Commented out an ATC which makes everything
	  block. Without this ATC, termination may fail in some peculiar
	  cases (see comment in file, prefixed with 'XXXXX').

Mon Feb  3 20:20:56 1997  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-parint.ads: Removed the kludge about Unit_Name. Since we are
	  not close yet to work with 3.09, it is not necessary. If we
	  decide to make a release which works with 3.09, then this kludge
	  will be added again.

Wed Jan 29 19:52:13 1997  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-parint.ads: Minor reformating.

Tue Jan 28 16:18:41 1997  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* ChangeLog: Removed spurious blank line introduced by the last
	  check-in !

	* s-parint.ads: Change '???' into 'XXXXX' which is our way of
	  indicating portions of code that are either not quite perfect or
	  likely to be modified in the future (workaround for
	  example). Also capitalize the explanation, to be style
	  conformant.

Wed Jan 22 17:32:39 1997  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* constants.sh: Use the current build directory instead of /tmp as
	a temporary dir to prevent blow up due to /tmp being full (shit
	happens!).

Tue Jan 14 18:34:50 1997  Laurent Pautet  <pautet@quasimodo.enst.fr>

	* s-parint.adb: Get rid of Htable (overkilling).

Tue Jan 14 10:06:14 1997  Laurent Pautet  <pautet@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-garhea.adb: Barrier -> Barrier_Type in Garlic.Utils.

	* s-parint.adb, s-parint.ads: It was not possible to query several
 	client elaboration requests from the same partition when the first
 	request was pending. Abortion of first RPC was unsafe and would
 	let the unit table in an inconsistent state. Synchronisation is
 	now a little bit less complex than it was. Restarting a partition
 	is now fully implemented (works on any partition, and not only on
 	boot partition). Code is a little bit cleaner.

Mon Jan 13 17:23:31 1997  Laurent Pautet  <pautet@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-garuti.ads, s-garuti.adb: No longer private to use it in
 	s-parint. Add a new semaphore type (with useful procedures to deal
 	with arrays).

Mon Jan 13 13:41:33 1997  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-rpc.adb: Changed prototype of Public_RPC_Receiver to match the
	access type whenever taking the 'Access at registration time.

	* s-parint.adb: Idem.

Thu Jan  9 14:24:40 1997  Laurent Pautet  <pautet@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-parint.adb: Implementation of partition restarting. Add a new
	procedure Invalidate_Receiving_Stub used by the programmer to
	signal to GARLIC to invalidate RNS info on a given partition and
	to the client cache to invalidate the old value and to query a new
	one.

	* s-garhea.ads, s-garhea.adb: Add a callback fonction to notify a
 	partition error to System.RPC. Add a registration procedure to
	enable System.RPC to register its callback.

	* s-rpc.adb: Provide a callback to be notified of partition
	error. This procedure unblocks pending RPCs with the dead
	partition. Requests table contains the partition id used for the
	associated RPC.

Fri Dec 20 12:10:08 1996  Laurent Pautet  <pautet@scapin.enst.fr>

	* s-stratt.adb: Raise Data_Error if an integer cannot be mapped
	onto its equivalent XDR integer.

Thu Dec 19 12:54:45 1996  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-parint.ads: Added dummy functions for Shared_Passive (needed
	  for the stub expansion).

	* s-parint.adb: Idem.

	* s-gartcp.adb: Removed a conversion between Interfaces.C.int and
	  pointer types because of a possible clash on 64 bits machines.

Mon Dec 16 15:26:02 1996  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-partyp.ads: Removed.

	* rci_info.ads: Removed (included in s-parint.ads).
	
	* rci_info.adb: Removed (included in s-parint.adb).

	* s-parint.ads: Inclusion of RCI_Info generic package.

	* s-parint.adb: Ditto.

	* Makefile.am: Removed rci_info.ad[bs] from file list.

Sat Nov 30 21:01:19 1996  Laurent Pautet  <pautet@quasimodo.enst.fr>

	* s-garopt.adb: For sure, serial is not the default protocol.

Fri Nov 29 12:43:07 1996  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-garela.adb: Replaced by an empty package.

	* s-garter.adb: On the boot server, launch the termination task
	  only if this partition is not permanent. On other partitions,
	  reject global termination if the partition is permanent.

	* s-garopt.ads: Added support for the new 'Permanent attribute.

	* s-garopt.adb: Ditto.

Thu Nov 28 22:33:30 1996  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* Makefile.am: Adapted for new elaboration packages.

	* two.py: Serial-line connector simulator (connects two sockets).

	* serial.c: Serial-line simulator using sockets. Changed procedure
	names to match the ones used in Spif.

	* s-gaseli.adb: Optimization. Changed procedure names to match the
	ones used in Spif.

	* s-garhea.adb: Added debug entries.

	* s-garela.adb: Removed useless faulty lines (do not work with
	serial protocol).

	* s-rpc.adb: Handle task non-abortion (which is quite frequent :-)
	more elegantly than before. It also corrects a strange
	segmentation fault in GNAT runtime which appeared only when
	debugging was off (that is a fast succession of events, probably a
	race condition in protected objects and entry family handling).
	
Wed Nov 27 18:42:47 1996  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-stratt.adb: Added pragma Suppress for range and overflow
	  checks.

	* s-gaseli.adb: Changed the protocol to make it simpler.
	  Changed this stupid protocol one more time.

Tue Nov 26 15:52:33 1996  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-ganobl.adb: Changed the safety delay to be 0.5 seconds.

Sat Nov 23 16:57:56 1996  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-gartcp.adb: Added missing constant.

Thu Nov 21 19:45:25 1996  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-gartcp.adb: Protect against very early internal error which
	  could propagate even when it's not fatal.

	* s-rpc.adb: Do not wait on protected entry in a finalization
	  procedure called during abortion. A flag showing that the result
	  will have to be invalidated when it arrives is set instead, thus
	  providing a much better respect of the semantic of abort (abort
	  very quickly) instead of waiting for the answer. If the answer
	  was there already, it's discarded.

Tue Nov 19 16:56:07 1996  Laurent Pautet  <pautet@quasimodo.enst.fr>

	* s-garela.adb: New package provided to set usual defaults.

	* s-garopt.adb: Add Set_[...] (Default : [...]) corresponding to
	Get_[...] return [...] in order to set defaults during elaboration
	of a new package system.garlic.elaboration.

	* s-gaprco.adb: Change System.Garlic.Config.Create into
	[...].Initialize.

Wed Nov  6 18:34:57 1996  Laurent Pautet  <pautet@inf.enst.fr>

	* s-gartcp.adb: sin_family was no longer initialized AF_INET.

Tue Oct 29 12:58:51 1996  Samuel Tardieu  <sam@inf.enst.fr>
