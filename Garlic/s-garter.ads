package System.Garlic.Termination is

   pragma Elaborate_Body;

   --  The termination algorithm tries to determine how many tasks are
   --  active (i.e. in a non-terminating state) on the system.
   --  It works by propagating two messages. The first one sends a Stamp
   --  to all known partitions, the second one asks all the partitions
   --  to know if it's OK for them to shutdown (i.e. there has been no
   --  activity since the timestamp was set). The answers arrive in
   --  an asynchronous fashion, and if, in a bounded time, not all the
   --  answers have arrived, we will retry and hope that the Send message
   --  will fail. Anyway, if a partition is completely dead and this fact
   --  is undetectable will lead to a non-terminating program. The algorithm
   --  may be improved provided that the interface of this package is
   --  not changed.

   --  All the subprograms have been embedded into the body, because a
   --  soft-links mechanism is used to reference them.
