README file for adasockets version 0.1.3 (beta)

AdaSockets is a medium binding (it is not a thin binding because it uses Ada
types and not a thick binding because you have the same subprogram names as
in C) for using BSD-style sockets in Ada.

This package is in no way complete! This is a half-day work that will be
extended in the future. If there is an extension that you would like to see in,
drop a note to the author (Samuel Tardieu <sam@inf.enst.fr>).

As you may have noticed, the name is not really original. If you have a better
name, send me a note with your suggestion.
