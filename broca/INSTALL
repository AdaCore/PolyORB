To install AdaBroker, execute:

  % ./configure
  % make              (or gmake if your make is not GNU make)
  % make install      (ditto)

This will install files under /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib and
/usr/local/lib/adabroker.

If you want to choose another prefix than /usr/local, give configure a
--prefix=whateveryouwant argument.

Note: at this time, you MUST use GNU make to compile this software.
