This files lists PolyORB's main features, as well as some known
limitations. These limitations will be addressed in next releases.

Configuration options
---------------------

Different configuration options allow for a complete control of the
middleware.

- PolyORB allows for the dynamic configuration of some of its internals
  through a detailled configuration file.

- 3 tasking runtimes:
  - No tasking
  - Full tasking, using constructions as proposed by tha Ada 95
    Reference Manual
  - Ravanscar, using a subset of Ada 95 constructions, ensuring
    determinism.

- ORB's request dispatching policies to control thread allocation:
  - Thread Pool
  - Thread Per Session (i.e. active connection)
  - Threas Per Request

IDL Compiler
------------

PolyORB provides idlac, a 'CORBA IDL to Ada' compiler written entirely
in Ada 95. It generates full stub and skeleton from a IDL contract.

It supports all common IDL constructs; yet it does not support the
following advanced constructs: valuetype, abstract interfaces.

CORBA
-----

PolyORB implements a CORBA application personality that supports:

- Static invocation models based on generated stub and skeletons,
- Dynamic Invocation Interface (DII), 
- Dynamic Skeleton Interface (DSI), 

And provides an implementation of the CORBA Portable Object Adapter.

GIOP
----

PolyORB proposes an implementation of the IIOP 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2
protocols.

Request marshalling operations are complete. Some requests messages
are not implemented, including: Cancel, Locate messages, and request
fragmentation.

CORBA Services
--------------

PolyORB implementats the CORBA COS Services:
- Event, 
- Interface Repository, 
- Naming,
- Time.

Note that the COS Naming current implementation does not support
corbaloc references.
