This files lists PolyORB's main features, as well as some known
limitations. These limitations will be addressed in next releases.

Configuration options
---------------------

Different configuration options allow for a complete control of the
middleware.

- PolyORB allows for the dynamic configuration of some of its internals
  through a detailed configuration file (see polyorb.conf for more details).

- 3 tasking runtimes:
  - No tasking;
  - Full tasking, using constructions as proposed by the Ada 95
    Reference Manual;
  - Ravenscar, using the Ada Ravenscar profile, ensuring
    determinism.

- ORB's request dispatching policies to control thread allocation:
  - Thread Pool;
  - Thread Per Session (i.e. active connection);
  - Thread Per Request;
  - Single Thread (if 'No Tasking' tasking runtime is used).

                               -----------
                               -- CORBA --
                               -----------

PolyORB implements a CORBA application personality that supports:

- Static invocation models based on generated stub and skeletons,
- Dynamic Invocation Interface (DII), 
- Dynamic Skeleton Interface (DSI), 

It also provides an implementation of the CORBA Portable Object
Adapter (POA). 

CORBA Services
--------------

PolyORB implements the following CORBA COS Services:
- Event, 
- Interface Repository, 
- Naming,
- Time.

Note that the current COS Naming implementation does not support
corbaloc references.

IDL Compiler
------------

PolyORB provides idlac, a CORBA 'IDL to Ada compiler' written entirely
in Ada 95. It generates full stub and skeleton from an IDL contract.

It supports all common IDL constructs; yet it does not support the
following advanced constructs: value-type, abstract interfaces.

                              ----------
                              -- GIOP --
                              ----------

PolyORB proposes an implementation of the IIOP 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2
protocols.

Request marshaling operations are complete. Some requests messages
are not implemented, including: Cancel, Locate messages, and request
fragmentation.

IIOP-level interoperability with other ORBs have been tested with
  - Jonathan 3.0
  - omniORB 4.0
  - OpenORB 1.3.0
