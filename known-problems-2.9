The following is a listing of known problems in releases 2.9.1 and 2.9.2.
Each entry contains a status line stating when the problem was fixed, and on
which release(s). In addition, any wavefront issued subsequent to the date
specified (in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD) also contains the fix. This can be used
to determine if a given release or wavefront has the fix identified in the
entry.

Note that older releases might or might not be affected by the problems listed
in this document.

Known problems fixed in 2.10.1 and above
----------------------------------------

KP-29-M603-008 Float marshalling error with endianness change

  Problem:    When a float is transported between hosts of different
              endiannesses, and full data validity checks are generated
              (configure switch --enable-debug=all), a spurious
              CONSTRAINT_ERROR may be raised for some specific values.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.10 on 2013-06-03

  Workaround: Do not enable full data validity checks.

KP-29-M313-015 Unsafe concurrent RCI lookups

  Problem:    When concurrent tasks attempt to retrieve the base reference
              for a remote RCI unit, incorrect coordination and unsafe
              concurrent accesses to shared data can cause spurious lookup
              failures to be reported to application code.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.10 on 2013-03-14

  Workaround: Guard RCI calls with handlers for System.RPC.Communication_Error
              and retry failed calls.

Known problems fixed in 2.9.2 and above
---------------------------------------

KP-29-M308-031 Application with tasking hands in remote call

  Problem:    If a partition has tasking, then in rare cases a race condition
              may cause a remote call to hang indefinitely.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.10 on 2013-03-08
              This was fixed in 2.9.2 on 2013-05-28

  Workaround: Use a select statement with asynchronous transfer of control
              to protect remote calls with a timeout.

KP-29-M308-030 Application with Ada starter hangs

  Problem:    The network access points opened by the main partition were
              incorrectly inherited by slave partitions when using an Ada
              starter, causing the slave partitions to fail to connect to
              the master partition, depending on which partition would
              receive the incoming connection notification.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.10 on 2013-03-06
              This was fixed in 2.9.2 on 2013-05-28

  Workaround: Do not use an Ada starter.
