This example describes a way to develop client / server
applications.

There are three main ada units in this bank example. The "bank" that
manages the client accounts, a "manager" which loads the accounts from
a small database and provides some utilities and clients which modify
their accounts and transfer money from their account to the account of
someone else. This is always the same executable for the different
clients, but of course, they don't get the same partition id in order
to differentiate them.

To play with this example, you can do the following :

% gnatdist simcity

Open (at least) 3 sessions.

[On session 1, starts the scenario, load "example" database and print
the account status]
