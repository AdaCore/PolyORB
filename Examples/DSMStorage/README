This example describes how to use the DSM storage support. This
storage support runs one of the Li and Hudak's algorithms. Therefore,
a shared passive package using this storage support cannot be
configured on a passive partition but on an active
partition. Moreover, the user has to prevent GLADE to use a light PCS
in order to run this algorithm. This cannot be automatically detected
as it is specific to this storage support.

Shared passive package Vector and RCI package Scheduler are configured
on part1. We use dsm:// as a data storage support for Vector. Client
and Server make concurrent computations of a shared vector. We are
going to run one instance of part1 and three instances of part2. Each
of these four partitions increments a different block of vector with
its partition id. Then, each partition does the same computation on
the next block. Before moving to the next block, the partitions
synchronize using Scheduler. At the end, each block has been modified
the same way and vector has been massively and concurrently modified.

part1 and part2 are active partitions.

Run in four separate sessions, one with part1 and three with part2.
As a result, all the vector item values are set to 10.
