	* check-config.in (exec_prefix): Quote variables in the last test
 	in case of blank characters (?!)

	* Prime/Makefile.am (all-local): Use ../check-stamp instead of
	  calling check-config each time.

	* check-config.in: don't use type anymore and make sure that the
	  gnatdist which is first in PATH is the right one.
