\opening{Sirs,}

I have been developing a set of reusable middleware components
known by the name of ``DROOPI'' (Distributed Reusable Object-Oriented
Polymorphic Infrastructure) as part of a research project at
ENST.

Per the institutions' statutes and my contractual relationships with ENST,
I am currently the sole owner of copyright on this work.

I would like to assign this copyright to the Free Software Fundation.
To this effect, I enclose a copyright assignment form.

\closing{Best regards,}

\end{letter}
