                  language. This paper describes a package providing a
                  remote procedure call facility, the options that
                  face the designer of such a package, and the
                  decisions we made. We describe the overall structure
                  of our RPC mechanism, our facilities for binding RPC
                  clients, the transport level communication protocol,
                  and some performance measures. We include
                  descriptions of some optimizations used to achieve
                  high performance and to minimize the load on server
                  machines that have many clients.",

                 satisfy the boolean expression. For explicit control of
                 the scheduling of resources, an event queue is
                 associated with a shared variable, and two procedures
                 await (event) (leave a critical region associated with
                 the shared variable and join the event queue) and cause
                 (event) (enable all processes in the event queue to

                  project consists in two successive steps. The first
                  one is CIAO, a DSA to CORBA translator. The second
                  one aims at the definition of a generic middleware
                  to be customized to DSA and CORBA. We propose a
                  definition and an architecture of services for a
                  generic middleware DROOPI and explain how it can be
                  customized according various criteria. This generic
                  middleware takes advantage of the lessons learned in
                  the design and the development of several other
                  projects: GLADE, AdaBroker and CIAO. Therefore, in

                  several ``personalities'' (e.g. CORBA, or RMI, or

  abstract =	 {We argue that objects that interact in a distributed
                  system need to be dealt with in ways that are
                  intrinsically different from objects that interact
                  in a single address space. These differences are
                  required because distributed systems require that
                  the programmer be aware of latency, have a different
                  model of memory access, and take into account issues
                  of concurrency and partial failure. We look at a
                  number of distributed systems that have attempted to
                  paper over the distinction between local and remote
                  objects, and show that such systems fail to support
                  basic requirements of robustness and
                  reliability. These failures have been masked in the
                  past by the small size of the distributed systems
                  that have been built. In the enterprise-wide
                  distributed systems foreseen in the near future,
                  however, such a masking will be impossible. We
                  conclude by discussing what is required of both
                  systems-level and application-level programmers and
                  designers if one is to take distribution seriously.},

  month =	 nov,
  abstract =	 {In order to support long-lived distributed objects,
                  object activation is required. Activation allows an
                  object to alternate between periods of activity,
                  where the object executes in a process; and periods
                  of dormancy, where the object is on disk and
                  utilizes no system resources. We describe an
                  activation protocol for distributed object
                  systems. The protocol features overall simplicity as
                  well as applicability to several different
                  activation models. We use the Modula-3 network
                  object system as a base for our implementation;
                  while we make no changes to the underlying network
                  object subsystem, we suggest a minor modification
                  that could be made to the marshalling of network
                  objects to assist in lazy activation, our preferred
                  activation model.},
