--  CODING GUIDELINES
--       for the
--   DROOPI project

--  $Id$

The Ada 95 Quality & Style Guide is included by reference.
Code layout should follow the usual GNAT practice.
Every package that can be declared Pure shall, then:
every package that can be Preelaborate shall, then:
every package that can have an Elaborate_Body pragma shall, then:
every package that cannot or need not have any of the above shall
have a comment that explains why.

Each file should start with comments that document its purpose,
followed by a blank line, followed by a comment containing the
repository id (filled automatically by the SCM system).

Keep elaboration code minimal. Perform initialization explicitly
in a library-level parameterless procedure called Initialize.

No direct use of protected objects. All synchronisation is
to be performed through Droopi.Soft_Links.

No dependencies on CORBA.* or Droopi.CORBA_P.* are allowed
anywhere except in units implementing the CORBA personality.

All the code shall be compiled with pragma Ravenscar.

The code shall not produce warnings when compiled with -gnatwa -gnaty.
Any use of pragma Warnings (Off) shall be documented by a comment.
