--  CODING GUIDELINES for the PolyORB project

--  $Id$

The Ada 95 Quality & Style Guide is included by reference.

Code layout should follow the usual GNAT practice.

Every package that can be declared Pure shall, then:
every package that can be Preelaborate shall, then:
every package that can have an Elaborate_Body pragma shall, then:
every package that cannot or need not have any of the above shall
have a comment that explains why.

Each file should start with the standard PolyORB copyright header,
then a blank line, then a comment that documents its purpose,
followed by a blank line, followed by a comment containing the
repository id (filled automatically by the SCM system).

If a package body needs to explcitly execute some code for its
initialization, this MUST NOT be done in the elaboration code.
Instead, a parameterless procedure Initialize must be declared
containing the necessary initialization code, and this procedure
should be registered with the automatic configurator, PolyORB.Configrator.

Direct use of protected objects is explicitly prohibited.
All synchronisation is to be performed through PolyORB.Soft_Links.

No dependencies on CORBA.* or PolyORB.CORBA_P.* are allowed
anywhere except in units implementing the CORBA personality.

All the code shall be compiled with pragma Ravenscar.

The code shall not produce warnings when compiled with -gnatwa -gnaty.
Any use of pragma Warnings (Off) shall be documented by a comment.
