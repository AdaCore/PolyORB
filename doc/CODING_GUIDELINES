--  CODING GUIDELINES
--       for the
--   DROOPI project

The Ada 95 Quality & Style Guide is included by reference.

Every package that can be declared Pure shall, then:
every package that can be Preelaborate shall.

Keep elaboration code minimal. Perform initialization explicitly.

No direct use of protected objects. All synchronisation is
to be performed through Droopi.Soft_Links.
