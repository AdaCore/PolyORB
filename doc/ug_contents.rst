Commands that are entered by the user are preceded in this manual by
the characters `'`$`'` (dollar sign followed by space). If
your system uses this sequence as a prompt, then the commands will
appear exactly as you see them in the manual. If your system uses some
other prompt, then the command will appear with the `$` replaced
by whatever prompt you are using.

Full file names are shown with the '`/`' character
as the directory separator; e.g., :file:`parent-dir/subdir/myfile.adb`.
If you are using GNAT on a Windows platform, please note that
the '`\\`' character should be used instead.
