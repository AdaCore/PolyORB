This TODO list is valid as of June 2000:
----------------------------------------

* marshalling of valueboxes. Since nothing is specified in the spec, I
suppose they are marshalled like regular valuetypes.

* marshalling of abstract interfaces. See spec, it has to be
  marshalled with a boolean discriminator to precise whether it is a
  valuetype or a regular interface.

* fragmentation in valuetype marshalling

* truncation in valuetype marhshalling

* custom marshalling

* semantic verification in the parser: identifier overloading (from
  supported interfaces and inherited valuetypes, between state members
  and factories)

* local interfaces

* implement IIOP > 1.0

* package .Delegate
