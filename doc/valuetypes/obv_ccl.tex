\chapter{Conclusion}

\paragraph{}Three main issues were mentionned in the introduction of
this report:
\begin {enumerate}
\item implementing the new CORBA 2.3 object hierarchy
\item operation dispatching on valuetypes
\item marshalling valuetypes
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{}The first two items were fully implemented and tested. I
only had time to describe precisely how the marshalling functions of
valuetypes can be implemented. However, I hope this description will
be precise enough for somebody else to implement it.
