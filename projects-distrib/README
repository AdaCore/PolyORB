The project files in this directory are for building clients of PolyORB.
See ../projects for building PolyORB itself.

Clients should import polyorb.gpr, which imports others as necessary.

These project files end up being installed in the <prefix>/lib/gnat/polyorb
directory, except for polyorb.gpr itself, which is installed in
<prefix>/lib/gnat.

For each project file in ../projects that builds a library, there is a project
file in this directory with the same name, which has the necessary commands to
allow gnatmake to find the corresponding installed .a file.
In addition, we have common.gpr and polyorb.gpr.
