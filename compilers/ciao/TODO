TODO file for CIAO
==================

$Id: //depot/ciao/main/TODO#1 $

All over CIAO, names are stored in nodes for usage occurrence
of entities. This should not happen anymore; when the name of
the entity denoted by a node is required, the (IDL) declaration
of the node should be looked up, and only /that/ node should have
a name.

It is guaranteed that Translate has been previously called for any unit
a given unit depends upon.
