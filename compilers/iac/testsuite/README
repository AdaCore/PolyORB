To add a new test:

 - Create a directory (<test_dir>) and put all the IDL files needed
   for the test in this directory.

 - Add a line in the MANIFEST file corresponding to the test:

   <test_dir>[/<idl_file>]:<test_category>

There are 4 test categories:

 1 - IDL tree tests. In this case the line added to the MANIFEST file
     must be in the form:

     <test_dir>/<idl_file>:idl_frontend

     <idl_file> is the valid IDL file. The test directory must contain
     a file 'test.out' that contains the expected output.

 2 - IDL errors tests: In this case the line added to the MANIFEST
     file must be in the form:

     <test_dir>/<idl_file>:idl_errors

     <idl_file> is the erroneous IDL file. The test directory must
     contain a file 'test.out' that contains the expected error
     message.

 3 - Ada Backend tests: In this case the line added to the MANIFEST
     file must be in one of these 2 forms:

     a - <test_dir>/<idl_file>:ada_backend

     In this case Ada code (stubs, skels and dummy impls) is generated
     from <idl_file> and then compiled.

     b - <test_dir>:ada_backend

     In this case Ada code (stubs, skels and dummy impls) is generated
     from all IDL files in <test_dir> and then compiled.

 4 - Types Backend tests: In this case the line added to the MANIFEST
     file must be in the form:

     <test_dir>/<idl_file>:types_backend

     <idl_file> is the valid IDL file. The test directory must contain
     a file 'test.out' that contains the expected output.
