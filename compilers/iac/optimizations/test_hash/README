This test compares the performances of the skeletons in these 3 cases :

 - No use of perfect hash function (if .. elsif .. elsif)
 - use of perfect hash function (CPU Time optimization)
 - use of perfect hash function (Memory Space optimization)

System requirements :

 - The PATH environment variable must permit the acces to :
 
   - iac (Idl to Ada Compiler)
   - the bin directory of GNAT
   - the bin directory of PolyORB
   - GNUPlot

To run the test, the user has two choices :

 - Build and run all programs with the help of the "build_and_run.sh" script
 - Build the three (client, servers) couples with the "build_test.sh". Then he 
   can run the tests in another machine not containig PolyORB (with the
   "run_only.sh" script)

In all cases, the user has to give a working directory name and a total number 
of iterations. For more details, run the scripts without command line arguments
in order to display a help message.

The "split.sh", "draw_eps.gnu" and "draw_png.gnu" script, are automatically 
copied to the working directory and are run to produce graphics of the test 
results (in the  "png" and "eps" formats).
