README for the IAC all_types example
----------------------------------------

This demo tests marshalling unmarshalling functions.

Three executables are provided
- server : a CORBA server application, provides echo<types> functions
  where types are CORBA defined types.

- client : a CORBA client application, built to interact with 'server',
  test all CORBA types.

* To run these tests :

1) client/server test :

- launch server
- launch client using the IOR string output by server as an argument

The client will interact with the server, doing several tests. The different
results are displayed on the client side.
