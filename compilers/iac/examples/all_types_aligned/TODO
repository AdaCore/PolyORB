- Sequence : Impossible to make a cast from CORBA.Sequence to 
	PolyORB.Aligned_Types.Sequence.

DONE :
- String : 
for the moment unbounded string is declaraed as an Aligned_Types.String and we 
use the type discriminant for string length 
	type arg (s_size : natural) is
	  record
		s : PolyORB.Aligned_Types.String (1 .. s_Size);
	  end record;

In memory we have at position 0 the discriminant (strign length) and the string
at position 4. For operation with multiple unbounded type this method doesn't 
work.

The right manner is to encapsulate the string in a struct with a discriminant 
like that :
	type arg (s_size : natural) is
	  record
		s : s_type (s_size);
	  end record;

	type s_type (s_type_size : natural) is
	  record
		s : PolyORB.Aligned_Types.String (1 .. s_Size);
	  end record;

to be done.
