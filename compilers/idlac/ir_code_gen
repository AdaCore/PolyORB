Design notes for the Interface Repository Infor code generator
--------------------------------------------------------------

$Id$

For each scope we generate a new package:
 Foo.IR_Info
that contains a function returning an IRObject reference
for each entity in the scope (caching previous results if
available).

This is generated as a separate package so that applications
that do not need the IR need not depend on it at all.
