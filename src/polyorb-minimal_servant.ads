--  A Minimal_Servant is servant independant from any application
--  personalities. It allows the creation of servants on top of PolyORB's
--  neutral core layer.
--
--  Hence, these servants can be made available to all applications
--  personalities, without the need of a specific one, allowing easy
--  deployment of common services.
--
--  However, it is a 'minimal' servant : it is incomplete and you will have
--  to write Invoke function corresponding to your servant.
--  This allows you to precisely control the servants created.
