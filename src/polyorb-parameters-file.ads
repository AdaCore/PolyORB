   --  PolyORB supports a global runtime configuration file.
   --  By default, the location of this file is Default_Filename.
   --  This default value can be overridden by setting the environment
   --  named by Filename_Variable.
   --
   --  The syntax of the configuration file is:
   --  - empty lines and lines that have a '#' in column 1 are
   --    ignored;
   --  - sections can be started by lines of the form
   --    '[' SECTION-NAME ']';
   --  - variable assignments can be performed by lines of the
   --    form VARIABLE-NAME '=' VALUE.
   --
   --  Anything else raises Syntax_Error.
   --
   --  Any variable assignment is local to a section.
   --  Assignments that occur before the first section declaration
   --  are relative to section [environment].
   --  Section and variable names are case sensitive.

   --  A variable Var.Iable in section [Sec] can be overridden by
   --  setting environment variable "POLYORB_SEC_VAR_IABLE"
   --  (see Make_Env_Name in body).
   --  Furthermore, each time a resolved in that section value
   --  starts with "file:", the contents of the file is used instead.
