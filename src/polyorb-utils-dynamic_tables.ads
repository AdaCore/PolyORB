--  This package provides one-dimensional, variable-size arrays support.

--  This package provides an implementation of dynamically resizable one
--  dimensional arrays. The idea is to mimic the normal Ada semantics for
--  arrays as closely as possible with the one additional capability of
--  dynamically modifying the value of the Last attribute.

--  This package is notionnaly equivalent to GNAT.Dynamic_Table's, yet
--   * it is Preelaborate (GNAT.Dynamic_Table can't because it System.Memory).
--   * declares a type that can be used to define dynamic instances of
--  the table, while an instantiation of GNAT.Table creates a single
--  instance of the table type.

--  Note: controlled types are not supported by this package. In particular
--  the type provided for Table_Component_Type may not be a controlled type.

generic
   type Table_Component_Type is private;
   type Table_Index_Type     is range <>;

   Table_Low_Bound : Table_Index_Type;
   Table_Initial   : Positive;
   Table_Increment : Natural;

   --  Table_Component_Type and Table_Index_Type specify the type of the
   --  array, Table_Low_Bound is the lower bound. Index_type must be an
   --  integer type. The effect is roughly to declare:

   --    Table : array (Table_Low_Bound .. <>) of Table_Component_Type;

   --  The Table_Component_Type can be any Ada type but note that default
   --  initialization will NOT occur for the array elements.

   --  The Table_Initial values controls the allocation of the table when
   --  it is first allocated, either by default, or by an explicit Init
   --  call.

   --  The Table_Increment value controls the amount of increase, if the
   --  table has to be increased in size. The value given is a percentage
   --  value (e.g. 100 = increase table size by 100%, i.e. double it).

   --  The Last and Set_Last subprograms provide control over the current
   --  logical allocation. They are quite efficient, so they can be used
   --  freely (expensive reallocation occurs only at major granularity
   --  chunks controlled by the allocation parameters).

   --  Note: we do not make the table components aliased, since this would
   --  restrict the use of table for discriminated types. If it is necessary
   --  to take the access of a table element, use Unrestricted_Access.
