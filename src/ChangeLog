	* Droopi.Opaque, Droopi.Buffers: Imported from Broca.
	Must change from System.Address-based implementation to portable
	code that can run on the JVM, possibly giving up some theoretical
	optimisation possibilities for now.

	* Droopi.Tasking_Policies: The implementation of the task-per-session
	policy depends on ORB, because the policy needs to create a task that
	executes the ORB => risk of circular dependency between ORB and
	Tasking_Policies.
