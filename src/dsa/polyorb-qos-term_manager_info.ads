--  This package is in charge of processing DSA_TM_Info service contexts.
--  DSA_TM_Info service contexts are used by clients to pass to the servers a
--  reference to their termination manager. When a request is received on the
--  server side, the function Extract_TM_Info is called. This function extracts
--  the reference from the QoS parameter and stores it in the requestor Binding
--  Object notepad. Later on, the termination manager will retrieve this
--  reference to reach the client's termination manager.
