TODO for Droopi
---------------

$Id$

Items still requiring attention
-------------------------------

* Support logging to syslog (also for Java ?)
* Unified runtime configuration file
  (modifications to Droopi.Log).
* Droopi.Buffers: remove mentions of CDR.

Items processed
---------------

* Data reception: when the protocol knows how much data will
  arrive, preallocate so that unmarshalling is guaranteed
  to be presented with contiguous data.
  When it does not, Receive_Buffer should call Receive_Socket
  with Length no greater than the available space in the
  chunk, and advance the current position by the exact
  size of the received data (2770).

* Rework Droopi.ORB event handling:
  The event handling loop must occur within the critical
  section (because it must mask certain sockets).
  Jobs should be created for each event, which will be
  actually processed by ORB tasks (2770).
