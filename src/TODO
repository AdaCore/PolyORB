TODO for Droopi
---------------

$Id$

* Support logging to syslog (also for Java ?)
* Unified configuration file (modifications to
  Droopi.Log).
* Droopi.Buffers: remove mentions of CDR.
* Data reception: when the protocol knows how much data will
  arrive, preallocate so that unmarshalling is guaranteed
  to be presented with contiguous data.
  When it does not, Receive_Buffer should call Receive_Socket
  with Length no greater than the available space in the
  chunk, and advance the current position by the exact
  size of the received data.
