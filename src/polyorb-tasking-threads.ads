--  This package provides the base abstract interface for threads.
--  Real implementations for the different profiles are given by extending
--  Thread_Type and by registering the implementations of some procedures.

--  Some terminology issues:
--  in this package, and in its profile-specific implementations,
--  a task designate the common abstraction of processors as provided
--  by the Ada 95 language.
--  A Thread will only denote the type defined in this package,
--  which is only a container for the parameters of the task.

   type Runnable_Controller is tagged limited null record;
