   --  When a request is synchronised With_Transport, the middleware must not
   --  return to the caller before the corresponding message message has been
   --  accepted by the transport layer.

   --  When a request is synchronised With_Server, the middleware does not
   --  return before receiving a confirmation that the request message has been
   --  received by the server middleware.

   --  When a request is synchronised With_Target, the middlware does not
   --  return to the caller before receinving a confirmation that the request
   --  has been executed by the target object.
