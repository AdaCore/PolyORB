DROOPI source code roadmap
--------------------------

$Id$

The source code of DROOPI is not for the faint of heart.
Caveat emptor.


./UNUSED/

Spare parts. Reserved for future use.

./droopi.ads

Empty package, provides a common namespace for generic ORB
components.

./corba/corba-*.ads

Standard CORBA packages

./corba/broca-*.ads

Internal components of the CORBA personality.

./droopi-orb.ads

Logging facility. Provides a unified means for other units
to output debugging, diagnostics and error messages.

./droopi-channels.ads

Channels are the objects that convert raw system transport
entities (sockets, message queues, shared memory segments,
avian carriers...) into unified message exchange abstractions.

./droopi-soft_links.ads

Abstraction layer for all library units that drag the tasking
runtime.

./droopi-protected_objects.ads

Implementation of soft_links for a context with tasking.
Uses protected objects.

./droopi-representations.ads

The abstraction of a method to represent data in a form
suitable for transmission. Children of this unit are expected
to derive the Droopi.Representations.Representation abstract
type into a concrete type implementing one representation
mechanism.

./droopi-jobs.ads

A Job is anything that can keep a task busy (like a Runnable
in Java). This unit declares an abstract Job type, and a means
to queue jobs for execution.

./sequences.ads
./sequences-bounded.ads
./sequences-unbounded.ads

{Bounded,unbounded} variable length arrays (cf. CORBA.Sequences.
Notionally based on Ada.Strings.Unbounded.)

Others are undocumented as of yet.
