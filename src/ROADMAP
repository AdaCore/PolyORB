DROOPI source code roadmap
--------------------------

$Id$

The source code of DROOPI is not for the faint of heart.
Caveat emptor.


./UNUSED/

Spare parts. Reserved for future use.

./droopi.ads

Empty package, provides a common namespace for generic ORB
components.

./corba/corba-*.ads

Standard CORBA packages

./corba/broca-*.ads

Internal components of the CORBA personality.

./droopi-orb.ads

Logging facility. Provides a unified means for other units
to output debugging, diagnostics and error messages.

./droopi-filters.ads

Layered components that form a protocol stack. Each
filter transmits SDUs (service data units) from its
lower layer to its upper layer, and can perform some
processing on the SDU and its associated data.

The lowest layer is a droopi.filters.sockets.socket_filter,
which does not receive SDUs from a lower layer but directly
from the ORB engine.

The uppermost layer is a Session, which does not actually
transmits SDUs to an upper layer but takes action based on
received SDUs.

./droopi-channels.ads

DEPRECATED.

./droopi-soft_links.ads

Abstraction layer for all library units that drag the tasking
runtime.

./droopi-protected_objects.ads

Implementation of soft_links for a context with tasking.
Uses protected objects.

./droopi-representations.ads

The abstraction of a method to represent data in a form
suitable for transmission. Children of this unit are expected
to derive the Droopi.Representations.Representation abstract
type into a concrete type implementing one representation
mechanism.

./droopi-jobs.ads

A Job is anything that can keep a task busy (like a Runnable
in Java). This unit declares an abstract Job type, and a means
to queue jobs for execution.

./sequences.ads
./sequences-bounded.ads
./sequences-unbounded.ads

{Bounded,unbounded} variable length arrays (cf. CORBA.Sequences.
Notionally based on Ada.Strings.Unbounded.)

Others are undocumented as of yet.
