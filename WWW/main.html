    (including our IDL -> Ada 95 compiler <tt>idlac</tt>), and CORBA and
    SOAP protocol personalities.

What is PolyORB?
</B></font></td></tr></table>

<p>
PolyORB is a polymorphic, reusable infrastructure for building object-oriented
distributed systems. Middleware environments are software libraries that
hide the complex issues of distribution and provide the programmer with
high-level abstractions that allow easy and transparent construction of
distributed applications. A number of different standards exist for
creating object-oriented distributed applications. These standards define
two things:
<ul>
<li>the interface seen by the developer's applicative objects;
<li>the protocol used by the middleware environment to talk to other
    nodes in the distributed application.
</ul>
Usually, middleware for one platform supports only one set of such
interfaces, and cannot interoperate with other platforms.

<p>
A polymorphic middleware allows the existence of several different
implementations of each of these aspects to be used within the same
middleware framework. In addition, PolyORB allows such different
personalities to coexist in the same instance of the running middleware;
it decouples the personality presented to applications on one side
("application personality"), and the personality presented to other middlewares
on the other side ("protocol personality"). Multiple implementations
of each personalisable aspect can coexist within the same instance of the
running middleware: unlike previous generic middlewares, PolyORB is
actually <em>schizophrenic</em>.

<p>
The decoupling of application and protocol personalities, and the support
for multiple simultaneous personalities within the same running middleware
are key features required for the construction of interoperable distributed
applications. This allows PolyORB to communicate with middlewares
that implement different distribution standards: PolyORB provides
<em>middleware-to-middleware</em> interoperability (M2M).

<p>
The PolyORB architecture also permits the automatic,
just-in-time creation of proxies between incompatible environments
(although this feature is not implemented yet).

<p>
<em>Note:</em> PolyORB is the project formerly known as DROOPI,
a Distributed Reusable Object-Oriented Polymorphic Infrastructure.

  From functional to architectural analysis of a middleware supporting

Using a middleware when designing a new distributed
                  application allows portability across numerous
                  software and hardware architectures, but introduces
                  a new layer of potential incompatibilities due to
                  the existence of various middleware
                  standards. PolyORB, our generic middleware, directly
                  addresses this problem: interoperability between
                  distribution models. It can be customized into
                  several ``personalities'' (e.g. CORBA, or RMI, or
                  Ada 95 DSA), such as Jonathan and Quarterware. It
                  also provides simultaneous support of multiple
                  personalities within a single middleware
                  instance. Software component implemented using a
                  given distribution model may thus interact with
                  remote entities from a different distribution
                  model. This paper identifies the functions required
                  to implement such a middleware and maps them on an
                  operational design.</blockquote></font>

  DROOPI: Towards a generic middleware.

This paper presents our work to bridge the Ada 95
                  Distributed Systems Annex (DSA) and CORBA to take
                  advantages of both environments facilities. Our
                  project consists in two successive steps. The first
                  one is CIAO, a DSA to CORBA translator. The second
                  one aims at the definition of a generic middleware
                  to be customized to DSA and CORBA. We propose a
                  definition and an architecture of services for a
                  generic middleware DROOPI and explain how it can be
                  customized according various criteria. This generic
                  middleware takes advantage of the lessons learned in
                  the design and the development of several other
                  projects: GLADE, AdaBroker and CIAO. Therefore, in
                  its motivation and its targetting, we believe DROOPI
                  is an original project.</blockquote></font>

                  may be found in similar projects. Our objective is

Comparing CORBA and the Ada 95 Distributed Systems
                  Annex shows that an advantage of CORBA is its Common

                  components for distributed application

While the Distributed Systems Annex of Ada 95
                  provides developers with a framework for easy
                  contruction of safe distributed systems, integrating
                  distribution seamlessly in the strong typing and
                  well-defined semantics of Ada, it lacks the
                  cross-platform, multiple-languages capabilities
                  offered by CORBA. This paper presents CIAO
                  (<em>CORBA Interface for Ada distributed
                  Objects</em>), a tool for automated generation of
                  proxies that allow CORBA clients to interact with
                  services created using the Distributed Systems
                  Annex. A representation of DSA service
                  specifications in OMG IDL is first presented. We
                  then describe an automated translation tool based on
                  this representation model. This tool is based on
                  ASIS, a standardized API for the extraction of
                  syntactic and semantic information from an Ada
                  compilation environment.</blockquote></font>

This toolkit has been developed (and tested) with

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gnat.com/" target="_top">GNAT 3.14a1</a></li>
</ul>

Some units to develop PolyORB are GNAT-specific:

<ul>
<li><b>GNAT.Regpat</b> used in the Simple Request Protocol.</li>

<li><b>GNAT.Debug_Pools</b> used for debugging purposes (dependency
  can be removed by using the standard system storage pool instead).

<li><b>GNAT.Sockets</b> used as the interface to the system socket API.

<li><b>GNAT.HTable</b> used in several contexts where hash tables were
  desired.
</ul>

<p>
If you want to build the SOAP protocol personality, you need to
install the <a href="http://libre.act-europe.fr/xmlada/" target="_top">XmlAda</a>
library.

<p>
If you want to regenerate all generated files in PolyORB, you may also
need the following tools:
<ul>
  <li>autoconf</li>
  <li>automake</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>gperf</li>
</ul>
(the files generated by these tools are included in the distribution,
so you do not need them in order to compile and install PolyORB, but
only if you make some changes to some internal PolyORB structures.)
If you do not have these tools installed, you can use the pre-generated
files included in the distribution.
