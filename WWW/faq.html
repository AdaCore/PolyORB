    <center><h2>Licensing issues</h2></center>

    <ol>

      <li><b>Who owns AdaBroker copyright?</b><br>
	AdaBroker is copyrighted by the
	<a href="http://www.infres.enst.fr/">Ecole Nationale Supérieure des
	  Télécommunications</a>. However, as AdaBroker is free software,
	you are allowed to use it according to the license (see question
	below).
	
	<p>
	  
      <li><b>May I use AdaBroker in commercial environments?</b><br>
	Short answer: <b>yes</b>. Long answer: the Ada code produced by the
	<i>idlac</i> IDL to Ada compiler keep the same copyright as
	the original IDL file. We claim no right at all on the code
	that may be added by <i>idlac</i>. The whole run time is
	covered by the GPL (General Public License), but a special
	clause has been added to let you instantiate generics or link
	with run time packages without having the GPL apply to
	<b>your</b> code.
	
	<p>
	  
      <li><b>What if I want to modify the IDL to Ada compiler?</b><br>
	As AdaBroker is distributed under the General Public License,
	your changes will be covered by the same license. That only
	means that if you want to redistribute a modified binary
	version of <i>idlac</i>, you will have to redistribute your
	changes under the General Public License. If you do not
	redistribute your modified version, you are not forced to
	redistribute your changes.
	
	<p>
	  
      <li><b>I want to include a modified version of idlac in my
	  proprietary product but I do not want to make the sources
	  available?</b><br>
	As copyright holders, we can make a special commercial
	agreement with you so that you can make a proprietary version
	of AdaBroker.
	
	<p>
	  
      <li><b>I want to distribute a binary version of AdaBroker, but I
	  do not want to support the burden of making the sources
	  available. How do I do that?</b><br>
	Same answer as above: contact us and we may make a special deal.
