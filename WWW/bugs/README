The following code represents a snapshot of the problem report
tracking system we use at Juniper.

This stuff is based on old code I wrote for FreeBSD, Inc, and has
a couple thousand cooks in the kitchen over time.  I should really
rewrite it from scratch and make it clean and quick, but who has
the time?

26/feb/1999 -- this code was rewritten to user perl5 and the standard CGI
		modules that come with perl5


- index.html - just a list of VERY basic commands to get folks started

- query-pr.cgi - perl script to display/pretty-print a particular bug

- query-pr-summary.cgi - bimodal perl script, can be run as either
  a cgi program or will output standard text

- submit-pr.cgi - Web based initial problem report submissions

  this is the meat of the package -- it will give you relatively extensive
  nice web based reports and link with query-pr.cgi to give you expanded
  detail on particular bugs.
