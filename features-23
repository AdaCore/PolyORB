PolyORB 2.3 NEW FEATURES LIST Current as of Jun 27, 2007
========================================================

Copyright (c) 2007, AdaCore

This file contains a complete list of new features in version 2.3 of PolyORB.
See also file NEWS for various information about this release.

An ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) appears in parentheses after the description line.
This date shows the implementation date of the feature. Any 2.3w wavefront
subsequent to this date will contain the indicated feature, as will any
subsequent releases.

NF-23-G627-011 Remove unused libraries from polyorb-config output (2007-03-14)

  The implementation libraries for CORBA Common Object Services,
  libpolyorb-corba-cos-*-impl, are usually not needed in user applications
  (only the client stubs are). They have therefore been removed from the
  command line produced by the polyorb-config utility.

  Applications that use these libraries now need to have explicit linker
  arguments for them.

NF-23-G329-021 Setting default log level (2007-03-29)

  A default log level setting can now be specified in the PolyORB runtime
  configuration (polyorb.conf, command line, or environment), which is applied
  to all facilities for which an explicit log level has not been provided.

NF-23-G214-008 Implementation of OMG Issue 5232 (2007-02-14)

  The OMG deprecated the use of anonymous type in IDL, but did not
  update CORBA IDL files. The issue 5232 has been filed by the OMG to
  fix this issue, and is now implemented in PolyORB. 

  As a consequence, the following IDL files have been updated:
  idls/Interop/CONV_FRAME.idl and idls/Interop/IOP.idl. Any user code
  that depends on these IDL specifications might require an update.

NF-23-G130-013 Extended syntax for port binding parameters (2007-01-31)

  The configuration parameters indicating what port a server should bind
  to have now an extended syntax. If a single port number is specified, only
  that precise value will be used. If the port is already bound by another
  process, partition startup will fail. If a port range of the form
  "NNNN-MMMM" is specified, the ORB will iterate over the range until an
  available port is found.

  Note that the default behaviour for a single port number specification
  has changed, since we used to always iterate until an available port
  was found. The new syntax allows explicit control over this behaviour.
  This provides a means of ensuring that a server does not unexpectedly
  bind to a different port than the one specified in runtime configuration
  parameters.

NF-23-FC18-009 No C++ compiler is required with recent GNAT (2007-04-26)

  New versions of the GNAT compiler now provide an IDL preprocessor. When
  this feature is present, no external C++ compiler is required to process
  OMG IDL files.
