Frontend :
==========
* Potential bug : When if the frontend and the backend languages have 
  common keywords, we are in trouble with the functions that recognize 
  the keywords (Set/Get_name_table_byte. Solution : put a prefix to 
  the keyword...
* Generate warning when, in an operation declaration, a parameter name
  is identical to the name of the root parent of another parameter type
  because the generated Ada code would not compile.
* Review the frontend part handling forward structs, types and unions

Backend Ada :
=============
* Handle name clashing when defining the same fixed type more than once in 
  the same immediate scope.
* Move the cyclic example to the test-suite
* Handle the case of complex declarators in exception members
* Handle CORBA Predefined sequence types initializers once the package 
  CORBA.IDL_Sequence.Helper.Init is created
* Add some type restrictions in file parsing
* Remove the Implementation dispatching call in skeletons when they are 
  not necessary (when there is not inheritance)
* Implement the Helpers initialization part using a subprogram per type
  (as done in Ocarina)
* Implement the generation of ir_info files
* Split long Repository_Ids to many lines...
* Add a command line flag to capitalize IDL names
* Operation contexts
* Implementing the AMI
* Implementing the AMH
* Optimizing the forwards
* Generate Code for "ValueType"s
* Generate comments that indicate the implicitly inherited operations and 
  attributes (from the first parent) and explicitly added operations and
  attributes (inherited from the second until the last parent) in interfaces.

Test-Suite :
===========
* For each new feature implemented, add the corresponding tests
