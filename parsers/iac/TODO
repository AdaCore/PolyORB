Frontend :
==========
* Review the frontend part handling forward structs, types and unions

Backend Ada :
=============
* Handle the cases of long lines by replacing the pragma style_check (off) by
  pragma style_check ("NM9999") and by splitting repository_id string when 
  it's necessary.
* Parameters whose type is based on an object type must be handled exactly like
  object type parametres (especially when using class-wide conversion)
* Implement complex scoped names imports (instead of global scopes)
* Factorize code in the testsuite, remove idlac-vs-iac tests since they are
  deprecated and make the testsuite compiler-independant
* Optimize SII code generation for sequences in order to allocate the
  sequence length in advance in the buffer
* Add a command line flag to capitalize IDL names
* Operation contexts
* Implementing the AMI
* Implementing the AMH
* Optimizing the forwards
* Generate Code for "ValueType"s
* Generate comments that indicate the implicitly inherited operations and 
  attributes (from the first parent) and explicitly added operations and
  attributes (inherited from the second until the last parent) in interfaces.

TestSuite :
===========
* For each new feature implemented, add the corresponding tests
