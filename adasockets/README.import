This directory is a stripped down version of the AdaSockets distribution,
that can be found at:

   http://www.infres.enst.fr/ANC/

Please use the full version for your projects, this directory lacks several
important stuff such as examples.

If you wish to use a newer version of AdaSockets with AdaBroker, here is the
way to proceed:

  o Unpack the new adasockets distribution into adasockets-M.N
  o Move adasockets-M.N as broca/adasockets, and change your current directory
    to get there
  o Remove the examples, man and support subdirectories
  o Edit Makefile.am and configure.in to replace all occurrences of "support"
    by "../support"
  o Run "aclocal -I ../support", "automake" and "autoconf" in turn.
  o Run "./configure && make distclean" to regenerate other files
  o Your next build of AdaBroker will then use the latest AdaSockets version
