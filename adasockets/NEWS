* New in AdaSockets 0.1.10

** New package Sockets.Stream_IO

A new package Sockets.Stream_IO allows the user to build a stream from an
existing socket. The stream can then be used as any other Ada stream.
Two new examples, stream_listener and stream_sender are provided to
demonstrate this feature.

** New procedure Receive_Some.

A new Receive_Some procedure, suggested by Laurent Guerby, allows the user
to get the first data available instead of waiting for the buffer to be
filled.

** Allow adasockets-config to be called with no parameter.

This has been suggested by Preben Randhol, and simplifies the gnatmake
command line whenever someone uses no library but adasockets.

* New in AdaSockets 0.1.9

** Add a new function Get_FD.

A new function Get_FD has been added in the Sockets package to let GtkAda users
add this descriptor to the list of descriptors to watch. Patch sent by
Bobby D. Bryant <bdbryant@mail.utexas.edu>.

* New in AdaSockets 0.1.8

** Change the building process

AdaSockets now comes as a shared and a non-shared library.

** Fix bugs on 64 bit platforms

The iovec_len field in sockets-thin.ads was incorrectly marked as being
an Integer instead of a Storage_Offset.

* New in AdaSockets 0.1.7

** Add support for FreeBSD

FreeBSD 3.x, 4.0 and 5.0-CURRENT are now supported out of the box.

* New in AdaSockets 0.1.6

** Add a `adasockets-config' script

The AdaSockets library can now be found automatically on your system if
it has been installed properly.

* New in AdaSockets 0.1.5

** Fix a race condition when using naming services

gethostbyname() and friends functions are not thread safe because they return
a pointer on a static memory zone. Incriminated calls are now protected by a
mutex. The overhead should be neglictible as those functions aren't usually
called often.

* New in AdaSockets 0.1.4

** Fix a descriptor leak when using TCP sockets

close() was not called properly after a socket has been shutdowned in
both directions. Since we do not want to add the burden of calling
close() onto the user, we record the state for each direction and call 
close() when appropriate.

** Fix an installation bug

In some situations (unexistant lib subdirectory in target prefix
directory), the installation directory was not properly created. This
is now fixed.

** Add some thin bindings entries

Thin bindigs entries have been added for socketpair() and AF_UNIX.

* New in AdaSockets 0.1.3

** Support for IP multicast

The package Sockets.Multicast can be used to create Multicast
interfaces on machine that support it.

** Interface changes

Some functions have been transformed into procedures to ease the
addition of multicast sockets.

** New example

The multi example can be used as both a multicast sender and receiver.

* New in AdaSockets 0.1.2

** Warning suppressed

Some versions of GNAT were detecting incorrectly a missing raise in
some cases. Signaled by Nicolas Ollinger <Nicolas.Ollinger@ens-lyon.fr>.

** New example

A listener example which is only a server has been added to avoid any
confusion between clients and servers. Suggestion by Scott Moody
<scott@plato.ds.boeing.com>.

* New in AdaSockets 0.1.1

** `aux' -> `support'

The subdirectory `aux' in the distribution has been renamed into
`support' to avoid a name clash on Windows NT with the standard
peripherical `aux'. Suggestion from Juanma Barranquero
<barranquero@laley-actualidad.es>.

** Better error messages

Exception raised during the connection now have messages in many cases 
explaining why the connexion could not be made.
