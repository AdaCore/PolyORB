KP-211-O213-032 Crash on unknown user exception

  Problem:    When a client and server are built with incompatible IDL
              specifications, and the server raises an exception not
              specified in the client IDL, the client crashes.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.12 on 2015-02-16

  Workaround: Make sure consistent IDL specifications are used between
              client and server code.
