Known problems fixed in 2.12.1 and above
----------------------------------------

KP-211-O807-004 Compilation fails when using --enable-conf-pragmas

  Problem:    Compilation fails if an additional configuration pragmas file
              is provided, and gprbuild is used to build PolyORB.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.12 on 2015-08-07

  Workaround: Add any required configuration pragmas to src/config.adc.in,
              then re-run configure without --enable-conf-pragmas.

KP-211-O415-015 Static parameters ignored if building with -O2

  Problem:    If PolyORB is built with -O2 optimization, then parameters
              set by the user using the PolyORB.Parameters.Static circuitry
              may not be taken into account.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.12 on 2015-04-28

  Workaround: Compile polyorb-parameters-static.adb with -O1 optimization.

KP-211-O301-002 Installed projects do not account for --enable-shared

  Problem:    When building PolyORB as shared libraries with --enable-shared,
              the installed project files still default to referencing a
              (nonexistent) static build.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.12 on 2015-03-10

  Workaround: When building an application, explicitly specify
              -XLIBRARY_TYPE=relocatable on the gprbuild command line.

KP-211-O213-032 Crash on unknown user exception

  Problem:    When a client and server are built with incompatible IDL
              specifications, and the server raises an exception not
              specified in the client IDL, the client crashes.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.12 on 2015-02-16

  Workaround: Make sure consistent IDL specifications are used between
              client and server code.
