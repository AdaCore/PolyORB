subsequent releases.

NF-210-M515-021 Macros in configuration file (2013-05-16)

   A macro expansion system is now provided for PolyORB runtime configuration
   parameters, when PolyORB is compiled with GNATCOLL.

NF-210-M315-027 Executable name in traces (2013-03-15)

   The name of the executable can now optionally be included in trace messages
   logged to standard error. This feature is enabled by setting "exe_name=true"
   in section [log] of the PolyORB configuration.

NF-210-M301-038 DSA application without name server (2013-03-15)

   Facilities are now provided to override the location of RCI units using
   run-time configuration parameters (from configuration file, command line,
   or environment variables). When all RCI locations are provided through
   configuration, the DSA name server can be disabled altogether, by specifying
   "None" as the name server type in the gnatdist configuration.

NF-210-M116-036 Performance improvements for unions (2013-01-23)

   Several adjustments have been made to the circuitry that handles the
   marshalling and unmarshalling of aggregates, and in particular unions
   with enum discriminant. This results in a significant performance
   improvement when handling such data.

NF-210-LC17-026 Use host name instead of IP address in CORBA IORs (2013-05-13)

   IIOP listening endpoint addresses can now be specified to be published
   by host name (rather than by IP address) in IORs.

NF-210-K811-013 Make predefined packages compatible with UTF-8 (2012-12-21)

   IAC generates pragma Wide_Character_Encoding to allow usage of prodefined
   CORBA packages in code with different encoding.

NF-210-F613-011 Shared libraries build (2013-01-17)

   PolyORB can now be built as a set of shared libraries using configure
   switches "--with-gprbuild --enable-shared".
