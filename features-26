This file contains a complete list of new features in version 2.5 of PolyORB.
See also file NEWS for various information about this release.

An ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) appears in parentheses after the description line.
This date shows the implementation date of the feature. Any 2.6w wavefront
subsequent to this date will contain the indicated feature, as will any
subsequent releases.

N6-26-I320-027 Performance of neutral and protocol layers (2009-04-14)

   The performance of the neutral and protocol layers has been improved
   significantly by guarding some costly and seldom useful debugging traces
   with appropriate configuration knobs, and by rewriting the management
   routines for some internal data structures to avoid repeated memory
   allocations and deallocations.

NF-26-H731-006 Improved handling of unbounded string arguments (2009-02-12)

   When using the Ada DSA applicative personality, remote calls involving
   arguments of type Ada.Strings.Unbounded.Unbounded_String now use the
   native PolyORB string type, providing better performance. Note that the
   PCS API has been updated, and this requries a corresponding compiler
   update.
