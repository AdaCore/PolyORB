NF-26-H731-016 Improved handling of unbounded string arguments (2009-02-12)

   When using the Ada DSA applicative personality, remote calls involving
   arguments of type Ada.Strings.Unbounded.Unbounded_String now use the
   native PolyORB string type, providing better performance. Note that the
   PCS API has been updated, and this requries a corresponding compiler
   update.
