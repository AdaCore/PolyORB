package Switch is

   --  Note: The default switch character is indicated by Switch_Character,
   --  but regardless of what it is, a hyphen is always allowed as an
   --  (alternative) switch character.

   --  Note: In GNAT, the case of switches is not significant if
   --  Switches_Case_Sensitive is False. If this is the case, switch
   --  characters, or letters appearing in the parameter to a switch, may be
   --  either upper case or lower case.

   function Is_Switch (Switch_Chars : String) return Boolean;
   --  Returns True iff Switch_Chars is at least two characters long,
   --  and the first character indicates it is a switch.

   function Is_Front_End_Switch (Switch_Chars : String) return Boolean;
   --  Returns True iff Switch_Chars represents a front-end switch,
   --  ie. it starts with -I or -gnat.
