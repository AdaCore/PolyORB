--  This package spec holds version information for GNAT, GNATBIND and
--  GNATMAKE. It is updated whenever the release number is changed.

package Gnatvsn is

   Gnat_Version_String : constant String := "3.16w (20020207)";
   --  Version output when GNAT (compiler), or its related tools, including
   --  GNATBIND, GNATCHOP, GNATFIND, GNATLINK, GNATMAKE, GNATXREF, are run
   --  (with appropriate verbose option switch set).
   --
   --  WARNING: some scripts rely on the format of this string. Any change
   --  must be coordinated with a script maintainer. Furthermore, no
   --  other variable in this package may have a name starting with
   --  Gnat_Version_String.

   Gnat_Version_Type : constant String := "GNATPRO";
   --  This string is set to one of three values:
   --
   --    "FSF    "
   --       GNAT FSF version. This version of GNAT is part of a Free Software
   --       Foundation release of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). The binder
   --       will not output informational messages regarding intended use.
   --       and the bug box generated by Comperr will give information on
   --       how to report bugs and list the "no warranty" information.
   --
   --    "GNATPRO"
   --       GNAT Professional version. This version of GNAT is supported
   --       by Ada Core Technologies. The binder will not output the
   --       usual "no warranty" messages, and the bug box generated by
   --       package Comperr will give instructions on bug submission
   --       that include references to customer number, ftp site etc.
   --
   --    "PUBLIC "
   --       GNAT Public version. This is a public version of GNAT, released
   --       by Ada Core Technologies and intended for educational use.
   --       The binder will output informational messages, and the bug box
   --       generated by the package Comperr will give appropriate bug
   --       submission instructions that do not reference customer number etc.
   --
   --  These are the only allowable settings for this string

   Ver_Len_Max : constant := 32;
   --  Longest possible length for Gnat_Version_String in this or any
   --  other version of GNAT. This is used by the binder to establish
   --  space to store any possible version string value for checks. This
   --  value should never be decreased in the future, but it would be
   --  OK to increase it if absolutely necessary.

   Library_Version : constant String := "GNAT Lib v3.15";
   --  Library version. This value must be updated whenever any change to the
   --  compiler affects the library formats in such a way as to obsolete
   --  previously compiled library modules.
   --
   --  Note: Makefile.in relies on the precise format of the library version
   --  string in order to correctly construct the soname value.
