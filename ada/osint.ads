     (N   : File_Name_Type;
      Lo  : in Source_Ptr;

   --  Allocates a Source_Buffer of appropriate length and then reads the
   --  entire contents of the source file N into the buffer. The address of
   --  the allocated buffer is returned in Src.

   --  Each line of text is terminated by one of the sequences:
   --
   --    CR

   --    LF/CR
   --    LF

   --  EOF characters in positions other than the last source character
   --  are treated as representing blanks).
   --
   --  The logical lower bound of the source buffer is the input value of Lo,
   --  and on exit Hi is set to the logical upper bound of the source buffer.
   --  Note that the returned value in Src points to an array with a physical
   --  lower bound of zero. This virtual origin addressing approach means that
   --  a constrained array pointer can be used with a low bound of zero which
   --  results in more efficient code.
   --
   --  If the given file cannot be opened, then the action depends on whether
   --  this file is the current main unit (i.e. its name matches the name
   --  returned by the most recent call to Next_Main_Source). If so, then the

   --  situation). The full name includes the appropriate directory
   --  information. The source file directory lookup penalty is incurred
   --  every single time the routines are called unless you have previously
   --  called Source_File_Data (Cache => True). See below.

   procedure Source_File_Data (Cache : Boolean);
   --  By default source file data (full source file name and time stamp)
   --  are looked up every time a call to Full_Source_Name (N) or
   --  Source_File_Stamp (N) is made. This may be undesirable in certain
   --  applications as this is uselessly slow if source file data does not
   --  change during program execution. When this procedure is called with
   --  Cache => True access to source file data does not encurr a penalty if
   --  this data was previously retrieved.

   -------------------------------------------
   -- Representation of Library Information --
   -------------------------------------------

   --  Associated with each compiled source file is library information,
   --  a string of bytes whose exact format is described in the body of
   --  Lib.Writ. Compiling a source file generates this library information
   --  for the compiled unit, and access the library information for units
   --  that were compiled previously on which the unit being compiled depends.

   --  How this information is stored is up to the implementation of this
   --  package. At the interface level, this information is simply associated
   --  with its corresponding source.

   --  Several different implementations are possible:

   --    1. The information could be directly associated with the source file,
   --       e.g. placed in a resource fork of this file on the Mac, or on
   --       MS-DOS, written to the source file after the end of file mark.

   --    2. The information could be written into the generated object module
   --       if the system supports the inclusion of arbitrary informational
   --       byte streams into object files. In this case there must be a naming
   --       convention that allows object files to be located given the name of
   --       the corresponding source file.

   --    3. The information could be written to a separate file, whose name is
   --       related to the name of the source file by a fixed convention.

   --  Which of these three methods is chosen depends on the contraints of the
   --  host operating system. The interface described here is independent of
   --  which of these approaches is used.

   -- Library Information Input --

   --  Returns False right away if no source files, or if all source files
   --  have been processed.

   function Next_Main_Lib_File return File_Name_Type;
   --  This function returns the name of the next library info file specified
   --  on the command line. It is an error to call Next_Main_Lib_File if no
   --  more library information files exist (i.e. Next_Main_Lib_File may be
   --  called only if a previous call to More_Lib_Files returned True). This
   --  name is the simple name, excluding any directory information.

   function Read_Library_Info
     (Lib_File  : File_Name_Type;

   --  source of the library information from the library information file
   --  whose name is given by the parameter Name.
   --
   --  See description of Read_Source_File for details on the format of the
   --  returned text buffer (the format is identical). THe lower bound of
   --  the Text_Buffer is always zero
   --
   --  If the specified file cannot be opened, then the action depends on
   --  Fatal_Err. If Fatal_Err is True, an error message is given and the
   --  compilation is abandoned. Otherwise if Fatal_Err is False, then null
   --  is returned. Note that the Lib_File is a simple name which does not
   --  include any directory information. The implementation is responsible
   --  for searching for the file in appropriate directories.
   --
   --  If Opt.Check_Object_Consistency is set to True then this routine
   --  checks whether the object file corresponding to the Lib_File is
   --  consistent with it. The object file is inconsistent if the object
   --  does not exist or if it has an older time stamp than Lib_File.
   --  This check is not performed when the Lib_File is "locked" (i.e.
   --  read/only) because in this case the object file may be buried
   --  in a library. In case of inconsistencies Read_Library_Info
   --  behaves as if it did not find Lib_File (namely if Fatal_Err is
   --  False, null is returned).

   procedure Read_Library_Info

   --  ALI file exists, then its file name is returned in Name, and its
   --  text is returned in Text. If the file does not exist, then Text is
   --  set to null.

   function Full_Library_Info_Name return File_Name_Type;
   function Full_Object_File_Name return File_Name_Type;
   --  Returns the full name of the library/object file most recently read
   --  using Read_Library_Info, including appropriate directory information.
   --  Calling this routine entails no library file directory lookup
   --  penalty. Note that the object file corresponding to a library file
   --  is not actually read. Its time stamp is fected when the flag
   --  Opt.Check_Object_Consistency is set.

   function Current_Library_File_Stamp return Time_Stamp_Type;
   function Current_Object_File_Stamp return Time_Stamp_Type;
   --  The time stamps of the files returned by the previous two routines.
   --  It is an error to call Current_Object_File_Stamp if

   function Library_File_Stamp (N : File_Name_Type) return Time_Stamp_Type;
   --  Returns the full name/time stamp of library file N. N should not
   --  include path information. Note that if the file cannot be located
   --  No_File is returned for the first routine and an all blank time stamp
   --  is returned for the second (this is not an error situation). The
   --  full name includes the appropriate directory information. The library
   --  file directory lookup penalty is incurred every single time this
   --  routine is called.

   function Object_File_Name (N : File_Name_Type) return File_Name_Type;
   --  Constructs the name of the object file corresponding to library
   --  file N. If N is a full file name than the returned file name will
   --  also be a full file name. Note that no lookup in the library file
   --  directories is done for this file. This routine merely constructs
   --  the name.

   -- Library Information Output --
   --------------------------------

   --  These routines are used by the compiler to generate the library
   --  information file for the main source file being compiled. See section
   --  above for a discussion of how library information files are stored.

   procedure Create_Output_Library_Info;
   --  Creates the output library information file for the source file which
   --  is currently being compiled (i.e. the file which was most recently
   --  returned by Next_Main_Source).

   procedure Write_Library_Info (Info : String);
   --  Writes the contents of the referenced string to the library information
   --  file for the main source file currently being compiled (i.e. the file
   --  which was most recently opened with a call to Read_Next_File). Info
   --  represents a single line in the file, but does not contain any line
   --  termination characters. The implementation of Write_Library_Info is
   --  responsible for adding necessary end of line and end of file control
   --  characters to the generated file.

   procedure Close_Output_Library_Info;
   --  Closes the file created by Create_Output_Library_Info, flushing any
   --  buffers etc from writes by Write_Library_Info.

   function Lib_File_Name (Source_File : File_Name_Type) return File_Name_Type;
   --  Given the name of a source file, returns the name of the corresponding
   --  library information file. This may be the name of the object file, or
   --  of a separate file used to store the library information. In either case
   --  the returned result is suitable for use in a call to Read_Library_Info.
   --  Note: this subprogram is in this section because it is used by the
   --  compiler to determine the proper library information names to be placed
   --  in the generated library information file.

   ------------------------------
   -- Debug Source File Output --
   ------------------------------

   --  These routines are used by the compiler to generate the debug source
   --  file for the Debug_Generated_Code (-gnatD switch) option. Note that
   --  debug source file writing occurs at a completely different point in
   --  the processing from library information output, so the code in the
   --  body can assume these functions are never used at the same time.

   function Create_Debug_File (Src : File_Name_Type) return File_Name_Type;
   --  Given the simple name of a source file, this routine creates the
   --  corresponding debug file, and returns its full name.

   procedure Write_Debug_Info (Info : String);
   --  Writes contents of given string as next line of the current debug
   --  source file created by the most recent call to Get_Debug_Name. Info
   --  does not contain any end of line or other formatting characters.

   procedure Close_Debug_File;
   --  Close current debug file created by the most recent call to
   --  Get_Debug_Name.

   function Debug_File_Eol_Length return Nat;
   --  Returns the number of characters (1 for NL, 2 for CR/LF) written
   --  at the end of each line by Write_Debug_Info.

   --------------------------------
   -- Semantic Tree Input-Output --
   --------------------------------

   procedure Tree_Create;
   --  Creates the tree output file for the source file which is currently
   --  being compiled (i.e. the file which was most recently returned by
   --  Next_Main_Source), and initializes Tree_IO.Tree_Write for output.

   procedure Tree_Close;
   --  Closes the file previously opened by Tree_Create

   -------------------
   -- Binder Output --
   -------------------

   --  These routines are used by the binder to generate the C source file
   --  containing the binder output. The format of this file is described
   --  in the package Bindfmt.

   procedure Create_Binder_Output
     (Output_Filename : String;
      Typ             : Character;
      Bfile           : out Name_Id);
   --  Creates the binder output file. Typ is one of
   --
   --    'c'   create output file for case of generating C
   --    'b'   create body file for case of generating Ada
   --    's'   create spec file for case of generating Ada
   --
   --  If Output_Filename is null, then a default name is used based on
   --  the name of the most recently accessed main source file name. If
   --  Output_Filename is non-null then it is the full path name of the
   --  file to be output (in the case of Ada, it must have an extension
   --  of adb, and the spec file is created by changing the last character
   --  from b to s. On return, Bfile also contains the Name_Id for the
   --  generated file name.

   procedure Write_Binder_Info (Info : String);
   --  Writes the contents of the referenced string to the binder output file
   --  created by a previous call to Create_Binder_Output. Info represents a
   --  single line in the file, but does not contain any line termination
   --  characters. The implementation of Write_Binder_Info is responsible
   --  for adding necessary end of line and end of file control characters
   --  as required by the operating system.

   procedure Close_Binder_Output;
   --  Closes the file created by Create_Binder_Output, flushing any
   --  buffers etc from writes by Write_Binder_Info.

   -----------------
   -- Termination --
   -----------------

   type Exit_Code_Type is (
      E_Success,    -- No warnings or errors
      E_Warnings,   -- Compiler warnings generated
      E_No_Code,    -- No code generated
      E_No_Compile, -- Compilation not needed (smart recompilation)
      E_Errors,     -- Compiler error messages generated
      E_Fatal,      -- Fatal (serious) error, e.g. source file not found
      E_Abort);     -- Internally detected compiler error

   procedure Exit_Program (Exit_Code : Exit_Code_Type);
   --  A call to Exit_Program terminates execution with the given status.
   --  A status of zero indicates normal completion, a non-zero status
   --  indicates abnormal termination.

   -------------------------
   -- Command Line Access --
   -------------------------

   --  Direct interface to command line parameters. (We don't want to use
   --  the predefined command line package because it defines functions
   --  returning string)

   function Arg_Count return Natural;
   pragma Import (C, Arg_Count, "arg_count");
   --  Get number of arguments (note: optional globbing may be enabled)

   procedure Fill_Arg (A : System.Address; Arg_Num : Integer);
   pragma Import (C, Fill_Arg, "fill_arg");
   --  Store one argument

   function Len_Arg (Arg_Num : Integer) return Integer;
   pragma Import (C, Len_Arg, "len_arg");
   --  Get length of argument

end Osint;
