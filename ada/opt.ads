   --  lowercase or all uppercase letters as appropriate. Note that this
   --  setting has no effect if the external name is given using an identifier
   --  in the case of extended DEC import/export pragmas (in this case the
   --  casing is controlled by External_Name_Imp_Casing), and also has no
   --  effect if an explicit Link_Name is supplied (a link name is always
   --  used exactly as given).

   Float_Format : Character := ' ';
   --  GNAT
   --  A non-blank value indicates that a Float_Format pragma has been

   --  of GNAT), in which case this variable is set to D or G for
   --  D_Float or G_Float.

   Force_ALI_Tree_File : Boolean := False;
   --  GNAT
   --  Force generation of ali file even if errors are encountered.
   --  Also forces generation of tree file if -gnatt is also set.

   --    'n'  No upper characters (Ada/83 rules)
   --    'w'  Latin-1 plus wide characters allowed in identifiers
   --
   --  The setting affects the set of letters allowed in identifiers and the
   --  upper/lower case equivalences. It does not affect the interpretation of
   --  character and string literals, which are always stored using the actual
   --  coding in the source program. This variable is initialized to the

   Operating_Mode : Operating_Mode_Type := Generate_Code;
   --  GNAT
   --  Indicates the operating mode of the compiler. The default is generate

   --  Set to True if the list of compilation commands should not be output.

   Shared_Libgnat : Boolean;
   --  GNATBIND
   --  Set to True if a shared libgnat is requested by using the -shared

   --  the compilation phases.

   Strict_Math : aliased Boolean := False;
   --  GNAT
   --  This switch is set True if the current unit is to be compiled in
   --  strict math mode. The effect is to cause certain library file name

   Suppress_Options : Suppress_Record;
   --  GNAT
   --  Flags set True to suppress corresponding check, i.e. add an implicit
   --  pragma Suppress at the outer level of each unit compiled. Note that
   --  these suppress actions can be overridden by the use of the Unsuppress
   --  pragma. This variable is initialized by Osint.Initialize.

   Table_Factor : Int := 1;
   --  Factor by which all initial table sizes set in Alloc are multiplied.
   --  Used in Table to calculate initial table sizes (the initial table
   --  size is the value in Alloc, used as the Table_Initial parameter
   --  value, multiplied by the factor given here. The default value is
   --  used if no -gnatT switch appears.

   Task_Dispatching_Policy : Character := ' ';
   --  GNAT
   --  Set to ' ' for the default case (no task dispatching policy specified).
   --  Reset to first character (uppercase) of task dispatching policy name
   --  if a valid Task_Dispatching_Policy pragma is encountered.

   Tasking_Used : Boolean := False;
   --  Set True if any tasking construct is encountered. Used to activate the
   --  output of the Q line in ali files.

   Time_Slice_Set : Boolean := False;
   --  Set True if a pragma Time_Slice is processed in the main unit, or
   --  if the T switch is present to set a time slice value.

   Time_Slice_Value : Nat;
   --  Time slice value. Valid only if Time_Slice_Set is True, i.e. if a
   --  Time_Slice pragma has been processed. Set to the time slice value
   --  in microseconds. Negative values are stored as zero, and the value
   --  is not larger than 1_000_000_000 (1000 seconds). Values larger than
   --  this are reset to this maximum.

   Tolerate_Consistency_Errors : Boolean := False;
   --  GNATBIND
   --  Tolerate time stamp and other consistency errors. If this switch is
   --  set true, then inconsistencies result in warnings rather than errors.

   Tree_Output : Boolean := False;
   --  GNAT
   --  Set True to generate output tree file

   Try_Semantics : Boolean := False;
   --  GNAT
   --  Flag set to force attempt at semantic analysis, even if parser errors
   --  occur. This will probably cause blowups at this stage in the game. On
   --  the other hand, most such blowups will be caught cleanly and simply
   --  say compilation abandoned.

   Unique_Error_Tag : Boolean := Tag_Errors;
   --  GNAT
   --  Indicates if error messages are to be prefixed by the string error:
   --  Initialized from Tag_Errors, can be forced on with the -gnatU switch.

   Unreserve_All_Interrupts : Boolean := False;
   --  GNAT, GNATBIND
   --  Normally set False, set True if a valid Unreserve_All_Interrupts
   --  pragma appears anywhere in the main unit for GNAT, or if any ALI
   --  file has the corresponding attribute set in GNATBIND.

   Upper_Half_Encoding : Boolean := False;
   --  GNAT
   --  Normally set False, indicating that upper half ASCII characters are
   --  used in the normal way to represent themselves. If the wide character
   --  encoding method uses the upper bit for this encoding, then this flag
   --  is set True, and upper half characters in the source indicate the
   --  start of a wide character sequence.

   Usage_Requested : Boolean := False;
   --  GNAT, GNATBIND, GNATMAKE
   --  Set to True if h switch encountered requesting usage information

   Use_VADS_Size : Boolean := False;
   --  GNAT
   --  Set to True if a valid pragma Use_VADS_Size is processed

   type Validity_Checking_Type is (None, Default, Full);
   Validity_Checking : Validity_Checking_Type := Default;
   --  GNAT
   --  Indicates level of checking for invalid values (i.e. values outside
   --  the range of a subtype caused by uninitialized variables, as discussed
   --  in (RM 13.9.1(9-11)).
   --
   --    None = No validity checking
   --
   --      No special checks for invalid values are performed. This means
   --      that references to uninitialized variables can cause erroneous
   --      behavior from constructs like case statements and subscripted
   --      array assignments. Given that the RM allows these operations
   --      to be implementation defined, it is arguable whether this mode
   --      meets the letter of the RM, but it certainly does not meet the
   --      spirit of the requirement!
   --
   --    Default = standard RM required validity checking
   --
   --      This is the default level of validity checking. In this mode
   --      checks are made to prevent erroneous behavior in accordance
   --      with the above RM reference. Notably extra checks may be needed
   --      for case statements and subscripted array assignments.
   --
   --    Full = Full validity checking
   --
   --      In this mode, every assignment is checked for validity, so that
   --      it is impossible to assign invalid values. The RM specifically
   --      allows such assignments, but in this mode, invalid values can
   --      never be assigned, and an attempt to perform such an assignment
   --      immediately raises Constraint_Error. This behavior is allowed
   --      (but not required) by the RM.

   Verbose_Mode : Boolean := False;
   --  GNAT, GNATBIND
   --  Set to True to get verbose mode (full error message text and location
   --  information sent to standard output, also header, copyright and summary)

   Warn_On_Biased_Rounding : Boolean := False;
   --  GNAT
   --  Set to True to generate warnings for static constants that are rounded
   --  in a manner inconsistent with unbiased rounding (round to even). Can
   --  be modified by use of -gnatwb/B.

   Warn_On_Hiding : Boolean := False;
   --  GNAT
   --  Set to True to generate warnings if a declared entity hides another
   --  entity. The default is that this warning is suppressed.

   Warn_On_Redundant_Constructs : Boolean := False;
   --  GNAT
   --  Set to True to generate warnings for redundant constructs (e.g. useless
   --  assignments/conversions). The default is that this warning is disabled.

   type Warning_Mode_Type is (Suppress, Normal, Treat_As_Error);
   Warning_Mode : Warning_Mode_Type := Normal;
   --  GNAT, GNATBIND
   --  Controls treatment of warning messages. If set to Suppress, warning
   --  messages are not generated at all. In Normal mode, they are generated
   --  but do not count as errors. In Treat_As_Error mode, warning messages
   --  are generated and are treated as errors.

   Wide_Character_Encoding_Method : WC_Encoding_Method := WCEM_Brackets;
   --  GNAT
   --  Method used for encoding wide characters in the source program. See
   --  description of type in unit System.WCh_Con for a list of the methods
   --  that are currently supported. Note that brackets notation is always
   --  recognized in source programs regardless of the setting of this
   --  variable. The default setting causes only the brackets notation
   --  to be recognized. If this is the main unit, this setting also
   --  controls the output of the W=? parameter in the ali file, which
   --  is used to provide the default for Wide_Text_IO files.

   Xref_Active : Boolean := True;
   --  GNAT
   --  Set if cross-referencing is enabled (i.e. xref info in ali files)

   Zero_Cost_Exceptions_Val : Boolean;
   Zero_Cost_Exceptions_Set : Boolean := False;
   --  GNAT
   --  These values are to record the setting of the zero cost exception
   --  handling mode set by argument switches (-gnatZ/-gnatL). If the
   --  value is set by one of these switches, then Zero_Cost_Exceptions_Set
   --  is set to True, and Zero_Cost_Exceptions_Val indicates the setting.
   --  This value is used to reset Zero_Cost_Exceptions_On_Target.

   -- Configuration Settings --
   ----------------------------

   --  These are settings that are used to establish the mode at the start
   --  of each unit. The values defined below can be affected either by
   --  command line switches, or by the use of appropriate configuration
   --  pragmas in the gnat.adc file.

   Ada_83_Config : Boolean;
   --  GNAT
   --  This is the value of the configuration switch for Ada 83 mode, as set
   --  by the command line switch -gnat83, and possibly modified by the use
   --  of configuration pragmas Ada_95 and Ada_83 in the gnat.adc file. This
   --  switch is used to set the initial value for Ada_83 mode at the start
   --  of analysis of a unit. Note however, that the setting of this switch
   --  is ignored for internal and predefined units (which are always compiled
   --  in Ada 95 mode).

   Dynamic_Elaboration_Checks_Config : Boolean := False;
   --  GNAT
   --  Set True for dynamic elaboration checking mode, as set by the -gnatE
   --  switch or by the use of pragma Elaboration_Checking (Dynamic).

   Extensions_Allowed_Config : Boolean;
   --  GNAT
   --  This is the switch that indicates whether extensions are allowed.
   --  It can be set True either by use of the -gnatX switch, or by use
   --  of the configuration pragma Extensions_Allowed (On). It is always
   --  set to True for internal GNAT units, since extensions are always
   --  permitted in such units.

   External_Name_Exp_Casing_Config : External_Casing_Type;
   --  GNAT
   --  This is the value of the configuration switch that controls casing
   --  of external symbols for which an explicit external name is given. It
   --  can be set to Uppercase by the command line switch -gnatF, and further
   --  modified by the use of the configuration pragma External_Name_Casing
   --  in the gnat.adc file. This switch is used to set the initial value
   --  for External_Name_Exp_Casing at the start of analyzing each unit.
   --  Note however that the setting of this switch is ignored for internal
   --  and predefined units (which are always compiled with As_Is mode).

   External_Name_Imp_Casing_Config : External_Casing_Type;
   --  GNAT
   --  This is the value of the configuration switch that controls casing
   --  of external symbols where the external name is implicitly given. It
   --  can be set to Uppercase by the command line switch -gnatF, and further
   --  modified by the use of the configuration pragma External_Name_Casing
   --  in the gnat.adc file. This switch is used to set the initial value
   --  for External_Name_Imp_Casing at the start of analyzing each unit.
   --  Note however that the setting of this switch is ignored for internal
   --  and predefined units (which are always compiled with Lowercase mode).

   Polling_Required_Config : Boolean;
   --  GNAT
   --  This is the value of the configuration switch that controls polling
   --  mode. It can be set True by the command line switch -gnatP, and then
   --  further modified by the use of pragma Polling in the gnat.adc file.
   --  This switch is used to set the initial value for Polling_Required
   --  at the start of analyzing each unit.

   Use_VADS_Size_Config : Boolean;
   --  GNAT
   --  This is the value of the configuration switch that controls the use
   --  of VADS_Size instead of Size whereever the attribute Size is used.
   --  It can be set True by the use of the pragma Use_VADS_Size in the
   --  gnat.adc file. This switch is used to set the initial value for
   --  Use_VADS_Size at the start of analyzing each unit. Note however that
   --  the setting of this switch is ignored for internal and predefined
   --  units (which are always compiled with the standard Size semantics).

   type Config_Switches_Type is private;
   --  Type used to save values of the switches set from Config values

   procedure Save_Opt_Config_Switches (Save : out Config_Switches_Type);
   --  This procedure saves the current values of the switches which are
   --  initialized from the above Config values, and then resets these
   --  switches according to the Config value settings.

   procedure Set_Opt_Config_Switches (Internal_Unit : Boolean);
   --  This procedure sets the switches to the appropriate initial values.
   --  The parameter Internal_Unit is True for an internal or predefined
   --  unit, and affects the way the switches are set (see above).

   procedure Restore_Opt_Config_Switches (Save : Config_Switches_Type);
   --  This procedure restores a set of switch values previously saved
   --  by a call to Save_Opt_Switches.

   procedure Register_Opt_Config_Switches;
   --  This procedure is called after processing the gnat.adc file to record
   --  the values of the Config switches, as possibly modified by the use
   --  of command line switches and configuration pragmas.

   ------------------------
   -- Other Global Flags --
   ------------------------

   Expander_Active : Boolean := False;
   --  A flag that indicates if expansion is active (True) or deactivated
   --  (False). When expansion is deactivated all calls to expander routines
   --  have no effect. Note that the initial setting of False is merely to
   --  prevent saving of an undefined value for an initial call to the
   --  Expander_Mode_Save_And_Set procedure. For more information on the
   --  use of this flag, see package Expander. Indeed this flag might more
   --  logically be in the spec of Expander, but it is referenced by Errout,
   --  and it really seems wrong for Errout to depend on Expander.
