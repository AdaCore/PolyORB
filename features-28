NF-28-K806-001 Improve behaviour in tasking intensive context (2011-08-29)

   Taking advantage of a new feature in the GNAT runtime library, a
   performance bottleneck has been removed in the PolyORB full tasking
   profile. This significantly improves performance in situations where a
   large number of tasks need to be created and destroyed.

NF-28-JC17-036 Support for partition-wide RPC timeout setting (2010-12-23)

   A new runtime parameter rpc_timeout in section [dsa] specifies a global
   timeout (in milliseconds) to be applied to all remote subprogram calls.

NF-28-JA25-023 Support for additional configuration pragmas (2010-10-26)

   A new configure command line switch --enable-conf-pragmas is provided, which
   allows the user to specify then name of an additional configuration pragmas
   file to be used when compiling the PolyORB runtime library, for example
   containing some application-mandated Restrictions pragmas.

NF-28-J121-026 IDLAC is obsoleted (2011-03-28)

   The legacy IDL to Ada compiler, idlac, is obsoleted. Users should switch
   to iac, which has been the default since 2008.
