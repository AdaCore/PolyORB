=============================

Copyright (C) 2009-2011, AdaCore

This file contains a complete list of new features in version 2.8 of PolyORB.
See also file NEWS for various information about this release.

An ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) appears in parentheses after the description line.
This date shows the implementation date of the feature. Any 2.8 wavefront
subsequent to this date will contain the indicated feature, as will any
subsequent releases.

NF-28-K919-038 Improved installation script (2011-09-19)

   The PolyORB Makefiles do not rely on xargs(1) and install(1). Instead,
   installation is performed by an equivalent Python script, which avoids
   spawning a lot of processes.

NF-28-K909-043 Exceptions tracing (2011-09-09)

   A new debugging trace is now available that logs a message for every
   exception raised in a partition (using GNAT.Exception_Actions).

NF-28-K906-034 Support for new IDL pragmas (2011-09-06)

   IAC implements support for new IDL pragmas defined in version 1.3 of
   the CORBA/Ada mapping: subtype, derived, and range. It also includes
   support for implementation defined pragma switchname, compatible with
   the GNACK IDL compiler, to help in transitioning legacy Ada code to
   CORBA.

NF-28-K806-001 Improve behaviour in tasking intensive context (2011-08-29)

   Taking advantage of a new feature in the GNAT runtime library, a
   performance bottleneck has been removed in the PolyORB full tasking
   profile. This significantly improves performance in situations where a
   large number of tasks need to be created and destroyed.

NF-28-JC17-036 Support for partition-wide RPC timeout setting (2010-12-23)

   A new runtime parameter rpc_timeout in section [dsa] specifies a global
   timeout (in milliseconds) to be applied to all remote subprogram calls.

NF-28-JA25-023 Support for additional configuration pragmas (2010-10-26)

   A new configure command line switch --enable-conf-pragmas is provided, which
   allows the user to specify then name of an additional configuration pragmas
   file to be used when compiling the PolyORB runtime library, for example
   containing some application-mandated Restrictions pragmas.

NF-28-J121-026 IDLAC is obsoleted (2011-03-28)

   The legacy IDL to Ada compiler, idlac, is obsoleted. Users should switch
   to iac, which has been the default since 2008.

NF-28-IA01-037 Source included in iac output (2011-09-24)

   The IAC compiler now includes the IDL source code (commented out) in the Ada
   stubs package spec, for convenient reference.
