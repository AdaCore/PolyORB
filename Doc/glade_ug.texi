@chapter Introduction to Distributed Systems

A distributed system architecture comprises a network of computers and the
software components that execute on those computers. Such architectures are
commonly used to improve the performance, reliability, and reusability of
complex applications. Typically, there is no shared address space
available to remotely-located components (that is to say, components running
on different nodes of the network), and therefore these components must
communicate using some form of message-passing.

@section Using OS Network Services

There are several programming techniques for developing distributed
applications. These applications have traditionally been developed using
network programming interfaces such as sockets. Programmers explicitly
have to perform calls to operating system services, a task that can be
tedious and error-prone. This includes initializing socket connection
and determining peer location, marshaling and unmarshaling data
structures, sending and receiving messages, debugging and testing
several programs at the same time, and porting the application to several
platforms to uncover subtle differences between various network interfaces.

Of course, this communication code can be encapsulated in wrappers to reduce 
its complexity, but it is clear that most of it can be automatically
generated. Message passing diverts developer's attention from the
application domain. The query and reply scenario is a classical scheme
in distributed applications; using message passing for such a scheme
can be compared to using a ``goto'' mechanism in a non-distributed
application.  This is considered unacceptable methodology in modern software 
engineering. A more robust design is be to use a
structured approach based on procedure calls.

In some respects, network programming can be compared to the
multi-threading programming issue. The user can decide to split his code
into several pieces and to multiplex the thread executions himself, using a
table-driven model. The scheduling code ends up embedded into the user
code. This solution is error-prone and fragile in regard to any future
modification. Relying on an implementation of threads such as provided in
POSIX is a better solution. Relying on language primitives that support
concurrency, such as Ada tasks, is best.

@node Using a Middleware Environment, Using a Distributed Language, Using OS Network Services, Introduction to Distributed Systems
@section Using a Middleware Environment

A middleware environment is intended to provide high level abstractions
in order to easily develop user applications.  Environments like CORBA
or Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) provide a framework to
develop client/server applications based on the Remote Procedure Call model
(RPC). The RPC model is inspired from the query and reply
scheme. In rough analogy with a regular procedure call, arguments are pushed
onto a stream, along with some data specifying the remote procedure to
be executed. The stream is transmitted over the network to the
server. The server decodes the stream, performs the regular subprogram call
locally, and then puts the output parameters into another stream, along with the
exception (if any) raised by the subprogram execution. The server then
sends this stream back to the caller. The caller decodes the stream and raises
locally the exception if needed.

CORBA provides the same enhancements to the remote procedure model that
object-oriented languages provide to classical procedural languages.  These
enhancements include encapsulation, inheritance, type checking, and
exceptions. These features are offered through an Interface Definition
Language (IDL).

The middleware communication framework provides all the machinery to
perform, somewhat transparently, remote procedure calls or remote object
method invocations. For instance, each CORBA interface communicates
through an Object Request Broker (ORB). A communication subsystem such
as an ORB is intended to allow applications to use objects without being
aware of their underlying message-passing implementation. In addition. the user
may also require a number of more complex services to develop his
distributed application. Some of these services are indispensable, for example
a location service that allows clients to reference remote services via
higher level names, instead of a traditional scheme for addressing remote
services that use Internet host addresses and communication port
numbers. Other services provide domain-independent interfaces that are
frequently used by distributed applications.

If we return to the multi-thread programming comparison, the
middleware solution is close to what a POSIX library or a language like
Esterel@footnote{@t{ESTEREL} is an imperative synchronous language
designed for the specification and the development of reactive systems.}
would provide for developing concurrent applications. A middleware
framework like DCE is close to a POSIX library in terms of abstraction
levels. Functionalities are very low-level and very complex. CORBA is
closer to Esterel in terms of development process.  The control part of
the application can be specified in a description language. The
developer then has to fill-in automatically generated source code templates
(stub and skeletons) to build the computational part of the application. The
distribution is a pre-compilation process and the distributed boundaries
are always explicit. Using CORBA, the distributed part is written in IDL
and the core of the application is written in a host language such as C++.

@node Using a Distributed Language,  , Using a Middleware Environment, Introduction to Distributed Systems
@section Using a Distributed Language

Rather than defining a new language like the CORBA IDL, an alternative is
to extend an existing programming language with the addition of distributed
features. The distributed object paradigm provides a more
object-oriented approach to programming distributed systems. The notion
of a distributed object is an extension to the abstract data type that
allows the services provided in the type interface to be called
independently of where the actual service is executed. When combined
with object-oriented features such as inheritance and polymorphism,
distributed objects offer a more dynamic and structured computational
environment for distributed applications.

The Distributed Systems Annex (DSA) of Ada95 defines several
extensions that allow the user to write a distributed system entirely in
Ada.  The types of distributed objects, the services they provide, and
the bodies of the remote methods to be executed are all defined in conventional
Ada packages. The Ada95 model is analogous the Java/RMI model.
In both languages, the IDL is replaced by  well-defined language constructs. 
Therefore, the language supports both remote procedure
calls and remote object method invocations transparently, and the semantics
of distribution are consistent with the rest of the language.

A program written in such a language is intended to communicate with a
program written in the same language, but this apparent restriction has
several useful consequences. The language can provide more powerful
features because it is not constrained by the common features available
in all host languages. In Ada95, the user will define a specification of
remote services and implement them exactly as he would for ordinary,
non-distributed services. His Ada95 environment will compile them to
produce a stub file (on the caller side) and a skeleton file that
automatically includes the body of the services (on the receiver
side). Creating objects, obtaining or registering object references or
adapting the object skeleton to the user object implementation are made
transparent because the language environment has a full control on the
development process.

Comparing with multi-thread programming once again, the language
extension solution is equivalent to the solution adopted for tasking
facilities in Ada.  Writing a distributed application is as simple as
writing a concurrent application: there is no binding consideration and
no code to wrap.  The language and its run-time system take care of
most issues that would divert the programmer's attention from the
application domain.

@node The Distributed Systems Annex, Getting Started With GLADE, Introduction to Distributed Systems, Top
@chapter The Distributed Systems Annex

A critical feature of the Distributed Systems Annex (DSA) is that it allows the
user to develop his application the same way whether this application is
going to be executed as several programs on a distributed system, or as a
single program on a non-distributed system. The DSA has been designed
to minimize the source changes needed to convert
an ordinary non-distributed program into a distributed program.

The simplest way to start with DSA is to develop the
application on a non-distributed system. Of course, the design of the
application should take into account the fact that some units are going
to be accessed remotely. In order to write an Ada95 distributed program,
it is necessary for the user to label by means of categorization pragmas
some of library level compilation units of the application program. The units
which require
categorization are typically those that are called remotely, and those
that provide the types used in remote invocations.

In order to insure that distributed execution is possible, these units are
restricted to contain only a limited set of Ada constructs.
For instance, if the distributed system has no shared memory,
shared variables must be forbidden. To specify the nature of these restrictions,
the DSA provides different categorization pragmas, each of which excludes some
language constructs from the categorized package.

Of course, the user can develop the non-distributed application with his
usual software engineering environment. It is critical to note
that the user needs no specialized tools to develop his/her distributed
application. For instance, he can debug his application with the
usual debugger. Note that a non-distributed program is not to be confused with a
distributed application composed of only one program. The later is built
with the help of the configuration tool and includes the communication
library.

Once the non-distributed version of the program is complete, it has to be
configured into separate partitions, This step is surprisingly simple,
compared to that of developing the application itself. The configuration
step consists in mapping sets of compilation units into individual partitions,
and specifying the mapping between partitions and nodes in the computer
network. This mapping is specified and managed by means of GLADE.

The distributed version of the user application should work as is, but
even when a program can be built both as a non-distributed or a
distributed program using the same source code, there may still be
differences in program execution between the distributed and
non-distributed versions. These differences are  discussed in subsequent
sections (see @ref{Pragma Asynchronous} and @ref{Pragma
All_Calls_Remote}).

Developping a non-distributed application in order to distribute it
later is the natural approach for a novice. Of course, it is not
always possible to write a distributed application as a non-distributed
application. For instance, a client/server application does not belong
to this category because several instances of the client can be active
at the same time. It is very easy to develop such an application using
GLADE; we shall describe how to do this in the following sections.

@section Architecture of a Distributed Ada95 Application

A distributed system is an interconnection of one or more processing
nodes and zero or more storage nodes. A distributed program comprises
one or more partitions. A partition is an aggregate of library
units. Partitions communicate through shared data or RPCs. A passive
partition has no thread of control. Only a passive partition can be
configured on a storage node. An active partition has zero or more
threads of control and has to be configured on a processing node.

The library unit is the core component of an Ada95 distributed
application. The user can explicitly assign library units to a
partition. Partitioning is a post-compilation process. The user
identifies interface packages at compile-time. These packages are
categorized using pragmas. Each of these pragmas supports the use of one of
the following classical paradigms:

@itemize @bullet
@item Remote subprograms:
For the programmer, a remote subprogram call is similar to a regular
subprogram call. Run-time binding using access-to-subprogram types can
also be used with remote subprograms. These remote subprograms are
mostly declared in library units categorized as remote call interface
(RCI).
  
@item Distributed objects:
Special-purpose access types can be defined which designate remote
objects. When a primitive dispatching operation is invoked on an object
designated by such a remote access, a remote call is performed transparently
on the partition on which the object resides. The types of these distributed
objects are declared in library units categorized as remote types (RT).
  
@item Shared objects:
Global data can be shared between active partitions, providing a
repository similar to a shared memory, a shared file system or a
database. Entry-less protected objects allow safe concurrent access and update
shared objects. This feature is orthogonal to the notion of distributed
objects, which are only accessed through exported services. These shared 
objects are declared in library units categorized as shared passive (SP).

@end itemize

The remotely-called subprograms declared in a library unit categorized
as remote call interface (RCI) or remote types (RT) may be either
statically or dynamically bound. The partition on which a statically
bound remote subprogram is executed can be determined before the
call. This is a static remote subprogram call. In contrast, A remote method or 
a dereference of an access to remote subprogram are dynamically bound remote
calls, because the partition on which the remote subprogram is executed
is determined at runtime, by the actuals of the call.

In the following example, Data_1 and Data_2 are shared passive (SP)
library units. Data_1 is configured on a passive partition mapped on a
storage node. Partition_1 and Partition_2 are active partitions. Note
that under some circumstances, a partition, for instance Partition_2,
can be duplicated. To be duplicated, Unit_2 and Unit_3 which are
configured on Partition_2 have to provide only dynamically bound remote
subprograms. Otherwise, a partition calling a remote subprogram on
Unit_2 would not be able to statically determine where to perform the
remote call between the two instances of Unit_2.

@node Categorization Pragmas, Pragma Declared Pure, Architecture of a Distributed Ada95 Application, The Distributed Systems Annex
@section Categorization Pragmas

Library units can be categorized according to the role they play in a
distributed program. A categorization pragma is a library unit pragma
that restricts the kinds of declarations that can appear in a library unit
and possibly in its child units, as well as the legal semantic dependences
that the categorized unit can have. There are several categorization
pragmas :

@itemize @bullet
@item Remote_Call_Interface
@item Remote_Types
@item Shared_Passive
@item Pure
@end itemize

The following paragraphs do not present the detailed semantics of these
pragmas (formal details will be found in the Ada95 Reference Manual).
Their purpose is to give the reader an intuitive overview of
the purpose of these pragmas. If a library unit is not categorized, this
unit is called a normal unit and plays no special role in the distributed
application. Such a unit is duplicated on any partition in which it is
mentioned.

A parenthetical remark: to avoid the need for specific run-time
libraries for the DSA, the notion of remote rendez-vous has not been
introduced in Ada95: tasks cannot be invoked directly from one partition
to another. Therefore, declarations of task types and general protected types
with entries are not allowed in categorized Ada library units.


@node Pragma Declared Pure, Pragma Remote_Call_Interface, Categorization Pragmas, The Distributed Systems Annex
@section Pragma Declared Pure

This pragma is not specific to the Distributed Systems Annex. A pure
package can appear in the context of any package, categorized or not. 
A pure package is a preelaborable package that
does not contain the declaration of any variable or named access
type. It is particularly useful to define types, constants and
subprograms shared by several categorized packages. In contrast, normal
packages cannot appear in the context of categorized package declarations.
Because a pure package has no state, it can be duplicated on several partitions.

@node Overview of Pragma Remote_Call_Interface, Regular Remote Subprograms (RCI), Pragma Remote_Call_Interface, Pragma Remote_Call_Interface
@subsection Overview of Pragma Remote_Call_Interface

Library units categorized with this pragma declare subprograms that can be
called and executed remotely. An RCI unit acts as a server for remote calls.
There is no memory space shared between server and clients.
A subprogram call that invokes one such
subprogram is a classical RPC operation; it is a
statically bound operation, because the compiler can determine the identity
of the subprogram being called.

Dynamically bound calls are provided through two mechanisms:

@itemize @bullet

@item
The dereference of an access_to_subprogram value, i.e. a value whose type is 
a remote_access_to_subprogram (RAS).

@item
A dispatching call whose controlling argument is 
an access-to-class-wide operand,  (remote access on class wide
types - RACW). These remote access types can be declared in a RCI
package as well.

@end itemize

A remote access type (RAS or RACW) can be viewed as a fat pointer, that is 
to say a structure with a remote address and a local address (like an URL:
@t{<protocol>}://@-@t{<remote@code{-}machine>}/@-@t{<local@code{-}directory>}). The
remote address must denote the host of the partition on which the entity has
been created; the local address describes the local memory
address within the host.

It is very unlikely that RCI units can be duplicated in the distributed
system. An implementation may allow separate copies of a RCI unit as
long as it ensures that the copies present a consistent state to all clients.
In the general case, preserving consistency is very costly. For this reason, the
implementation may require a RCI unit to be unique in the distributed
system.

In the following example, a RCIBank offers several remote services:
Balance, Transfert, Deposit and Withdraw. On the caller side, the bank
client uses the stub files of unit RCIBank. On the receiver side,
the bank receiver uses the skeleton files of unit RCIBank including
the body of this package.

@subsection Remote Access to Subprograms (RAS)

In the following example, several mirroring banks offer their services
through the same database. Each bank registers a reference to each of
its services with a central bank. A client of the central bank requests a service
from one of the mirroring banks. To satisfiy requests, the RCI unit RASBank
defines Balance_Type, a remote access to subprogram (Recall that an access
type declared in a remote unit has to be either remote access to subprogram or
remote access to class wide type).

Note that to obtain a remote access to subprogram, the subprogram that delivers
the remote access must be
remote itself. Therefore, MirrorBank is a RCI library unit.

@include rasbank.ads.texi

In the code below, a mirroring bank registers its services to the
central bank.

@include mirrorbank.ads.texi
@include mirrorbank.adb.texi

In the code below, a central bank client asks for a mirroring bank and
calls the Balance service of this bank by dereferencing a remote access
type.

@subsection Remote Access to Class Wide Types (RACW)

A bank client is now connected to a bank through a terminal. The bank
wants to notify a connected client, bu means of a message on its terminal, when
another client transfers a given amount of money to his account. In the following
example, a terminal is designed as a distributed object. Each bank
client will register its terminal object to the bank server for further
use. In the code below, Term_Type is the root type of the distributed
terminal hierarchy.

@include terminal.ads.texi

In the code below, the RCI unit RACWBank defines Term_Access, a remote
access to class wide type. Term_Access becomes a reference to a
distributed object. In the next section, we will see how to derive and extend
Term_Type, how to create a distributed object and how to use a reference
to it.

Unlike RCI units, library units categorized with this pragma can define
distributed objects and remote methods on them. Both RCI and RT units
can define a remote access type as described above (RACW). A subprogram
defined in a RT unit is not a remote subprogram. Unlike RCI units, a RT
unit can be duplicated on several partitions in which case all its
entities are different with each other. This unit is different on each
partition in which it is defined.

@subsection Distributed Object

If we want to implement the notification feature proposed in the
previous section, we have to derive Term_Type. Such a derivation is
possible in a remote types unit like NewTerminal (see below). Any object
of type New_Term_Type becomes a distributed object and any reference to
such an object becomes a fat pointer or a reference to a distributed
object (see Term_Access declaration in @ref{Remote Access to Class Wide
Types (RACW)}).

@include newterminal.ads.texi

In the code below, a client registers his name and his terminal with
RACWBank. Therefore, when any payer transfers some
money to him, RACWBank is able to notify the client of the transfer of funds.

@include term1client.adb.texi

In the code below, a second client, the payer, registers his terminal
to the bank and executes a transfer to the first client.

@include term2client.adb.texi

In the code below, we describe the general design of Transfer. Classical
operations of Withdraw and Deposit are performed. Then, RACWBank
retrieves the terminal of the payee (if present) and invokes a
dispatching operation by dereferencing a distributed object Term. The
reference is examined at run-time, and the execution of this operation takes
place on the partition on  which the distributed object resides.

mechanism needed to place a value of the type into a communication stream.
The code below describes how to transmit a linked structure.

The package declaration provides a type definition of single-linked

The entities declared in such a categorized library unit are intended to be
mapped on a virtual shared address space (file, memory, database). When two
partitions use such a library unit, they can communicate by reading or
writing the same variable in the shared unit. This supports the conventional
shared variables paradigm.
Entryless protected objects can be declared in these units, to provide an
atomic access to shared data, thus implementing a  simple
transaction mechanism. When the address space is a file or a database,
the user can take advantage of the persistency features provided by
these storage nodes.

@subsection Shared and Protected Objects

In the code below, we define two kinds of shared
objects. External_Synchronization requires that the different partitions
updating this data synchronize to avoid conflicting operations on shared
objects. Internal_Synchronization provides a way to get an atomic
operation on shared objects. Note that only entry-less subprograms are
allowed in a shared passive unit.

a remote subprogram labelled with pragma Asynchronous allows statically and

wait for the completion of the remote call, and lets the caller continue
its execution. The remote procedure must have only
@b{in} parameters, and any exception raised during the execution of the
remote procedure is lost. 

When pragma Asynchronous applies to a regular subprogram with @b{in}
parameters, any call to this subprogram will be executed
asynchronously. The following declaration of AsynchronousRCI.Asynchronous gives
an example.

@include asynchronousrci.ads.texi
@include asynchronousrt.ads.texi

A pragma Asynchronous applies to a Remote Access_to_Subprogram (RAS).
An asynchronous RAS can be both
asynchronous and synchronous depending on the designated subprogram. For
instance, in the code below, remote call (1) is asynchronous but remote
call (2) is synchronous.

A pragma Asynchronous applies to a RACW as well. In this case, the
invocation of @b{any} method with in parameters is @b{always} performed
asynchronously. Remote method invocation (3) is asynchronous but remote
method invocation (4) is synchronous.

@include asynchronousmain.adb.texi

This feature supports the conventional message passing paradigm. The user must
be aware that this paradigm, and asynchronous remote calls
in particular, has several drawbacks:

@itemize @bullet

@item
It violates original (remote) procedure semantics

@item
It allows the equivalent of a remote GOTO mechanism

@item
It prevents easy development and debugging in a non-distributed context

@item
It can introduce potential race conditions

@end itemize

To illustrate the latter, let us take the following example:

@include node2.ads.texi
@include node2.adb.texi
@include node1.ads.texi
@include node1.adb.texi
@include nondeterministic.adb.texi

Let us say that Main is configured on Partition_0, Node1 on Partition_1
and Node2 on Partition_2. If Node1.Send and Node2.Send procedures were
synchronous or if no latency was introduced during network
communication, we would have the following RPC order: Main remotely
calls Node1.Send which remotely calls Node2.Send which sets V to
1. Then, Main remotely calls Node2.Send and sets V to 2.

Now, let us assume that both Send procedures are asynchronous and that
the connection between Partition_1 and Partition_2 is very slow. The
following scenario can very well occur. Main remotely calls Node1.Send
and is unblocked. Immediatly after this call, Main remotely calls
Node2.Send and sets V to 2. Once this is done, the remote call to
Node1.Send completes on Partition_1 and it remotely calls Node2.Send
which sets V to 1.

@node Pragma All_Calls_Remote, Generic Categorized Units  , Pragma Asynchronous, More About Categorization Pragmas
@subsection Pragma All_Calls_Remote

A pragma All_Calls_Remote in a RCI unit forces remote procedure
calls to be routed through the communication subsystem even for a local
call. This eases the debugging of an application in a non-distributed
situation that is very close to the distributed one, because the communication
subsystem (including marshalling and unmarshalling procedures) can be
exercised on a single node.

In some circumstances, a non-distributed application can behave
differently than an application distributed on only one partition. This
can happen when both All_Calls_Remote and
Asynchronous features are used at the same time (see @ref{Pragma
Asynchronous} for an example). Another circumstance occur when the
marshalling operations raise an exception. In the following example,
when unit ACRRCI is a All_Calls_Remote package, the program raises
Program_Error. When unit ACRRCI is no longer a All_Calls_Remote package, 
then the program completes silently.

@node Marshalling and Unmarshalling Operations, Incorrect Remote Dispatching, Partition Communication Subsystem, Partition Communication Subsystem
@subsection Marshalling and Unmarshalling Operations

The Partition Communication Subsystem  (PCS) marshalls and unmarshalls
caller and server data into a stream of type
@i{System.@-RPC.@-Params_Stream_Type}:

@smallexample

@b{type} Params_Stream_Type
  (Initial_Size : Ada.Streams.Stream_Element_Count) @b{is new}
    Ada.Streams.Root_Stream_Type @b{with private};

@end smallexample

This type is a container for the data to be transmitted between
partitions. Its root is @i{Root_Stream_Type}, which defines the basic
stream type and two abstract operations, @i{Write} and @i{Read}. Its
purpose is to insert / remove objects of type @i{Stream_Element_Array}
which are array of bytes representing a particular data.

Streams are read and written using four attributes:

@itemize @bullet

@item Write: write an element into a stream, valid only for constrained
types

@item Read: read a constrained element from a stream

@item Output: same as Write, but write bounds and discriminants as well
if needed

@item Input: same as Read, but read bounds and discriminants from
  the stream (the Input attribute denotes a function)
@end itemize

An Ada compiler provides default 'Read and 'Write operations. But it is
up to the implementation of the PCS to provide default 'Read and 'Write
to ensure proper
operation between heterogeneous architectures (see @ref{Heterogeneous
System}).

The user can overload these operations, except for predefined
types. Overloading with a textual version provides the user with a way
to debug its application (even outside of the Distributed Systems
Annex).

@include new_integers.ads.texi
@include new_integers.adb.texi

The language forces the user to provide read and write opertions for non-remote
access types. Transmitting an access value by dumping its content
into a stream makes no sense when it is going to be transmitted to
another partition (different memory spaces). To transmit non-remote
access types see @ref{Transmitting Dynamic Structure}.

@node Incorrect Remote Dispatching, Partition Ids, Marshalling and Unmarshalling Operations, Partition Communication Subsystem
@subsection Incorrect Remote Dispatching

When a remote subprogram takes a class wide argument, there is a risk of 
using an object of a derived type that will not be clean enough to be
transmitted. For example, given a type called Root_Type, if a 
remote procedure takes a Root_Type'Class as an argument, the user can
call it with an instance of Derived_Type that is Root_Type enriched with 
a field of a task type. This will lead to a non-communicable type to be
transmitted between partitions.

To prevent this, paragraph E.4(18) of the reference manual explains that
any actual type used as parameter for a remote call whose formal type is
a class wide type must be declared in the visible part of a Pure or
Remote_Types package. This property also holds for remote functions
returning class wide types. To summarize, the actual type used should
have been eligible for being declared where the root type has been
declared. If a `bad' object is given to a remote subprogram,
@i{Program_Error} will be raised at the point of the call.

@node Partition Ids, Concurrent Remote Calls, Incorrect Remote Dispatching, Partition Communication Subsystem
@subsection Partition Ids

U'Partition_ID identifies the partition where the unit U has been
elaborated. For this purpose, the PCS provides an integer type
Partition_ID to uniquely designate a partition. Note that a Partition_ID
is represented as a
universal integer, and has no meaning outside of the PCS. The RM
requires that two partitions of a distributed program have different
Partition_ID's at a given time. A Partition_ID may or may not be
assigned statically (at compile or link time). A Partition_ID may or
may not be related to the physical location of the partition.

Partition_ID's can be used to check whether a RCI package is configured locally.

@include check_pid.adb.texi

@node Concurrent Remote Calls, Consistency and Elaboration, Partition Ids, Partition Communication Subsystem
@subsection Concurrent Remote Calls

It is not defined by the PCS specification whether one or more threads of
control should be available to process incoming messages and to wait for
their completion. But the PCS implementation is required to be
reentrant, thereby allowing concurrent calls on it to
service concurrent remote subprogram calls into the server partition.
This means that at the implementation level the PCS manages a pool of
helper tasks. This (apart from performance) is invisible to the user.

@node Consistency and Elaboration, Abortion and Termination, Concurrent Remote Calls, Partition Communication Subsystem
@subsection Consistency and Elaboration

A library unit is consistent if the same version of its declaration is
used in all units that reference it. This requirement applies as well to
a unit that is referenced in several partitions of a distributed program.
If a shared passive or RCI library unit U is included in some partition P,
It is a bounded error to elaborate another partition P1 of a
distributed program that that depends on a different version of U.
As a result of this error, Program_Error
can be raised in one or both partitions during elaboration.

U'Version yields a string that identifies the version of the unit
declaration and any unit declaration on which it depends. U'Version_Body
yields a string that identifies the version of the unit body. These
attributes are used by the PCS to verify the consistency of an application.

After elaborating the library units, but prior to invoking the main
subprogram, the PCS checks the RCI unit versions, and then accept any
incoming RPC. To guarantee that it is safe to call receiving stubs, any
incoming RPC is kept pending until the partition completes its
elaboration.

@node Abortion and Termination,  , Consistency and Elaboration, Partition Communication Subsystem
@subsection Abortion and Termination

If a construct containing a remote call is aborted, the remote
subprogram call is cancelled. Whether the execution of the remote
subprogram is immediately aborted as a result of the cancellation is
implementation defined.

An active partition terminates when its environment task terminates. In
other terms, a partition cannot terminate before the Ada program itself 
terminates. The standard termination mechanism applies, but can be
extended with extra rules (see @ref{Partition Attribute Termination} for
examples).

@node Most Features in One Example,  , Partition Communication Subsystem, The Distributed Systems Annex
@section Most Features in One Example

The example shown on the following figure highlights most of
the features of DSA. The system is based on a set of factories
and workers and a storage.  Each entity is a partition itself. A
factory hires a worker from a pool of workers (hire - 1) and assigns a
job (query - 2) to him. The worker performs the job and saves the
result (reply - 3) in a storage common to all the factories.  The
worker notifies the factory of the end of his job (notify - 4).

@image{full-ex.fig}

When a worker has completed his job, the result must be saved in a
common storage. To do this, we define a protected area in SP package
Storage (see following code). An entry-less protected object ensures
atomic access to this area.

@include storage.ads.texi

Common is a Remote_Types package that defines most of the remote
services of the above system (see following code). First, we define a
way for the workers to signal the completion of his job. This callback
mechanism is implemented using RAS Notify.

@include common.ads.texi

We define an abstract tagged type Worker which is intended to be the
root type of the whole distributed objects hierarchy. Assign allows a
factory to specify a job to a worker and a way for the worker to signal its employer
the completion of this job. Any_Worker is a remote access to class wide type
(RACW). In other words, it is a reference to a distributed object of any
derived type from Worker class. Note that the two remote access types
(Any_Worker and Notify) are declared as asynchronous. Therefore, any
override of Assign will be executed asynchronously. To be asynchronous,
an object of type Notify has to be a reference to an asynchronous
procedure.

NewWorker is derived from type Worker and Assign is overridden.

@include newworkers.ads.texi

The following code shows how to derive a second generation of workers
NewNewWorker from the first generation NewWorker. As mentioned above,
this RT package can be duplicated on several partitions to produce
several types of workers and also several remote workers.

@include newnewworkers.ads.texi

In the following code, we define a unique place where workers wait for
jobs. WorkerCity is a Remote_Call_Interface package with services to
hire and free workers. Unlike Remote_Types packages,
Remote_Call_Interface packages cannot be duplicated, and are assigned
to one specific partition.

@include workercity.ads.texi

In order to use even more DSA features, Factory is defined as a generic
RCI package (see sample above). Any instantiation defines a new factory
(see sample above). To be RCI, this instantiation has to be categorized
once again.

@include factory.ads.texi
@include newfactory.ads.texi

@node Introduction to GLADE, How to Configure a Distributed Application, Getting Started With GLADE, Getting Started With GLADE
@section Introduction to GLADE

An Ada 95 distributed application comprises a number of partitions
which can be executed concurrently on the same machine or, and this is
the interesting part, can be distributed on a network of machines.
The way in which partitions communicate is described in Annex E of the
Ada 95 reference manual.

A partition is a set of compilation units that are linked together to
produce an executable binary. A distributed program comprises two or
more communicating partitions.

The Distributed Systems Annex (DSA) does not describe how a distributed
application should be configured. It is up to the user to define what
are the partitions in his program and on which machines they should be
executed.

The tool @t{gnatdist} and its configuration language 
allows the user to partition his program and to specify the
machines on which the individual partitions are to execute.

@t{gnatdist} reads a configuration file (whose syntax is described in
section @ref{The Configuration Language}) and builds several
executables, one for each partition. It also takes care of launching the
different partitions (default) with parameters that can be specific to each
partition.

@node How to Configure a Distributed Application, Gnatdist Command Line Options, Introduction to GLADE, Getting Started With GLADE
@section How to Configure a Distributed Application

@itemize @bullet

@item
Write a non-distributed Ada application, to get familiar with the GLADE
environment. Use the categorization pragmas to specify the packages that
can be called remotely.

@item
When this non-distributed application is working, write a configuration
file that maps the user categorized packages onto specific partitions. This
concerns particularly remote call interface and remote types packages.
Specify the main procedure of the distributed application (see
@ref{Partition Attribute Main}).

@item
Type `gnatdist @i{<configuration-file>}'.

@item
Start the distributed application by invoking the start-up shell script
or default Ada program (depending on the Starter option, see @ref{Pragma
Starter}).

gnatdist [switches] configuration-file [list-of-partitions]

@end smallexample

@c We should add some explanations of the gnatdist specific flags
@c -n, -M and on some peticular mechanism (a spec without a body).

The switches of @t{gnatdist} are, for the time being, exactly the same as those
of gnatmake. By default @t{gnatdist} outputs a configuration report and the
actions performed. The switch -n allows @t{gnatdist} to skip the first stage
of recompilation of the non-distributed application.

The names of all configuration files must have the suffix @t{.cfg}. There may be
several configuration files for the same distributed application, as the
user may want to use different distributed configurations depending on load
and other characteristics of the computing environment.

If a list of partitions is provided on the command line of the gnatdist
command, only these
partitions will be built. In the following configuration example, the
user can type :

@smallexample

gnatdist @i{<configuration> <partition_2> <partition_3>}

@end smallexample

@node Gnatdist Behind the Scenes, The Configuration Language, Gnatdist Command Line Options, Getting Started With GLADE
@section Gnatdist Behind the Scenes

Here is what goes on behind the scenes in @t{gnatdist} when building a
distributed application:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Each compilation unit in the program is compiled into an object module
(as for non distributed applications). This is achieved by calling
gnatmake on the sources of the various partitions.

@item
Stubs and skeletons are compiled into object modules (these are piece of
cade that allow a partition running on machine A to communicate with a
partition running on machine B). Several timestamp checks are performed
to avoid useless code recompilation and stub generation.

@item
@t{gnatdist} performs a number of consistency checks. For instance it checks
that all packages marked as remote call interface (RCI) and shared
passive (SP) are mapped onto partitions. It also checks that a RCI or SP
package is mapped onto only one partition.

@item
Finally, the executables for each partition in the program are
created. The code to launch partitions is embedded in the main partition
except if another option has been specified (see @ref{Pragma
Starter}). In this case, a shell script (or nothing) is generated to
start the partitions on the appropriate machines. This is specially
useful when one wants to write client / server applications where the
number of instances of the partition is unknown.

@subsection Language Keywords

All the Ada keywords are reserved keywords of the GLADE configuration
language. @t{gnatdist} generates full Ada code in order to build the
different executables. To avoid naming conflicts between Ada and
GLADE configuration language, all the Ada keywords have been reserved
even if they are not used in the configuration language.

There are three new keywords:

@itemize @bullet

@item @i{configuration} to encapsulate a configuration

@item @i{Partition} that is a predefined type to declare partitions

@item @i{Channel} that is a predefined type to declare channels between
partitions.

@end itemize

@node Pragmas and Representation Clauses, Configuration Declaration, Language Keywords, The Configuration Language

It is possible to modify the default behaviour of the configuration via
a pragma definition.

@smallexample

PRAGMA ::=

@end smallexample

It is also possible to modify the default behavior of all the partitions
(or channels) via an attribute definition clause applied to the
predefined type @b{Partition} (or @b{Channel}).

@smallexample

REPRESENTATION_CLAUSE ::=
   @b{for} Partition'ATTRIBUTE_NAME @b{use} ATTRIBUTE_ARGUMENTS;

@smallexample

REPRESENTATION_CLAUSE ::=

@end smallexample

When an attribute definition clause is applied to a given object of a

predefined type. In the next sections, attributes apply to a given
object rather than to the predefined type.

@node Configuration Declaration, Partition Declaration, Pragmas and Representation Clauses, The Configuration Language
@subsection Configuration Declaration

The distribution of one or several Ada programs is described by a single
configuration unit. This configuration unit has a specification part and
an optional body part. A configuration unit is declared as an Ada
procedure would be. The keyword @b{configuration} is reserved for this
purpose.

@node Partition Declaration, Partition Attribute Main, Configuration Declaration, The Configuration Language
@subsection Partition Declaration

In the declarative part, the user declares his partitions and can change
their default behavior. @t{gnatdist} provides a predefined type
@b{Partition}. The user can declare a list of partitions and can also
initialize these partitions with an initial list of Ada units.

@smallexample

@end smallexample

Once declared, a partition is an empty list of Ada units. The operator
@b{":="} adds the Ada units list on the right side to the current list
of Ada units that are already mapped to the partition. This is a
non-destructive operation. Whether a unit is a relevant Ada unit or not
is checked later on by the back-end of @t{gnatdist}. These assignments can
occur in the declarative part as well as in the body part.

@smallexample

ENUMERATION_OF_ADA_UNITS ::= (@{ADA_UNIT @{, ADA_UNIT@}@});

@end smallexample

@node Partition Attribute Main, Pragma Starter, Partition Declaration, The Configuration Language
@subsection Partition Attribute Main

Basically, the distributed system annex (DSA) helps the user in building
a distributed application from a non-distributed application (Of course,
this is not the only possible model offered by DSA). The user can design,
implement and test his application in a non-distributed environment, and
then should be able to switch from the non-distributed case to a
distributed case. As mentionned before, this two-phase design approach
has several advantages.

In a non-distributed case, the user executes only one main executable
possibly with a name corresponding to the main unit name of his
application. With @t{gnatdist}, in a distributed case, a main executable
with a name corresponding to the main unit name is responsible for
starting the entire distributed application. Therefore, the user
can start his application the same way he used to do in the
non-distributed case.

For this reason, the configuration language provides a way to declare
the main procedure of the non-distributed application.

@smallexample

MAIN_PROCEDURE_DECLARATION ::=
   @b{procedure} MAIN_PROCEDURE_IDENTIFER @b{is in} PARTITION_IDENTIFIER;

@end smallexample

In this case, the partition in which the main procedure has been mapped
is called the main partition. It includes in its code a call to this
main procedure. The main partition has an additional specific role,
because the boot server is located on it (see @ref{GLADE Internals}).

The main procedures for the other partitions have a null body. However,
the user can also modify this behavior by providing an alternate main
procedure. To do this, an alternate main subprogram has to be declared
and assigned to the partition Main attribute.

@node Pragma Starter, Pragma Boot_Server, Partition Attribute Main, The Configuration Language
@subsection Pragma Starter

As a default, the main executable is a full Ada starter procedure. That
means that it launches all the other partitions from an Ada program. The
pragma Starter allows the user to ask for one starter or another. When
the partition host is not statically defined (see @ref{Partition
Attribute Host}), the starter subprogram will ask for it interactively
when it is executed.

@smallexample

   @b{pragma} Starter ([CONVENTION =>] CONVENTION_LITERAL);

@end smallexample

@itemize @bullet

@item
The default method consists in launching partitions from the main
partition Ada subprogram using a remote shell.

@item
The user may ask for a Shell script that starts the different partitions
one at a time on the appropriate remote machines, using a remote
shell. As the Ada starter, the Shell script starter ask for partition
hosts interactively when a partition host is not already defined. Having
a textual shell script allows the user to edit it and to modify it
easily.

@item 
The user may ask for a None starter. In this case, it is up to the user
to launch the different partitions. The user may have to provide on the
command line the boot server location (see @ref{Architecture of GLADE PCS}).

@end itemize

@node Pragma Boot_Server, Partition Attribute Host, Pragma Starter, The Configuration Language
@subsection Pragma Boot_Server

When a partition starts executing, one of the first steps consists in a
connection to the boot partition where the boot server is located (see
@ref{Architecture of GLADE PCS}).

@smallexample

PRAGMA ::=
   @b{pragma} Boot_Server
     ([Protocol_Name =>] STRING_LITERAL,
      [Protocol_Data =>] STRING_LITERAL);

@end smallexample

This boot server location can be concatenated into a single string to be
used as a command line option or an environment variable (see
@ref{Command Line Option --boot_server}). The formatted string must
conform to the notation <protocol_name>://<protocol_data>. Most commonly,
this is tcp://<machine>:<port>, that means that the protocol name
is @i{tcp}. The protocol data which is specific to the protocol name is
@i{<machine>:<port>}.

@node Partition Attribute Host, Pragma Import, Pragma Boot_Server, The Configuration Language
@subsection Partition Attribute Host

Logical nodes (or partitions) can be mapped onto physical nodes. The
host-name can be either a static or dynamic value. In case of a static
value, the expression is a string literal. In case of a dynamic value,
the representation clause argument is a function that accepts a string
as parameter and that returns a string value. When the function is
called, the partition name is passed as parameter and the host-name is
returned.

@smallexample

FUNCTION_DECLARATION ::=
   @b{function} FUNCTION_IDENTIFIER
     (PARAMETER_IDENTIFIER : [@b{in}] String)
      @b{return} String;

REPRESENTATION_CLAUSE ::=
   @b{for} PARTITION_IDENTIFIER'Host @b{use} STRING_LITERAL;
 | @b{for} PARTITION_IDENTIFIER'Host @b{use} FUNCTION_IDENTIFIER;

@end smallexample

The signature of the function must be the following : it takes a
string parameter which corresponds to a partition name. It returns
a string parameter which corresponds to the host-name. The function
that returns the host-name can be an Ada function (default) or a shell
script. A pragma Import is used to import a function defined in Ada or
in Shell (see @ref{Pragma Import}).  

This function is called on the main partition by the GLADE PCS to launch
a given partition on a given logical node. In case of load balancing,
the function can return the most appropriate among a set of hosts.

@node Pragma Import, Partition Attribute Storage_Dir, Partition Attribute Host, The Configuration Language
@subsection Pragma Import

Two kinds of subprograms are allowed in the GLADE configuration
language. A main procedure is used as a partition Main attribute and a
function is used as a partition Host attribute.

@smallexample

The function can be an Ada function (default) or a shell script. To
import a shell script, the pragma Import must be used:

@smallexample

PRAGMA ::=
   @b{pragma} Import
      ([Entity        =>] FUNCTION_IDENTIFIER,
       [Convention    =>] CONVENTION_LITERAL,
       [External_Name =>] STRING_LITERAL);

@b{pragma} Import (Best_Node, Shell, "best-node");
@end smallexample

In this case, the GLADE PCS invokes the shell script with the partition
name as a command line argument. The shell script is supposed to return
the partition host-name (see @ref{Partition Attribute Host}).

@node Partition Attribute Storage_Dir, Partition Attribute Command_Line, Pragma Import, The Configuration Language
@subsection Partition Attribute Storage_Dir

Storage_Dir allows the user to specify in which directory the partition
executable is stored. This can be useful in heterogeneous systems when
the user wants to store executables for the same target in a given
directory. Specifying the directory is also useful if the partition
executable is not directly visible from the user environment. For
instance, when a remote command like @b{rsh} is invoked, the executable
directory has to be present in the user path. If the Storage_Dir
attribute has been specified, the executable full name is used.

The user may want to pass arguments on the command line of a

@subsection Partition Attribute Termination

The Ada95 Reference Manual does not provide any specific rule to handle global
termination of a distributed application (see @ref{Abortion and Termination}).

In GLADE, by default, a set of partitions terminates when each
partition can terminate and when no message remains to be delivered. A
distributed algorithm that checks for this global condition
is activated periodically by the main boot server.

@smallexample

TERMINATION_LITTERAL ::= Global_Termination |
                         Local_Termination  |
                         Defered_Termination

REPRESENTATION_CLAUSE ::=
   @b{for} PARTIITON_IDENTIFIER'Termination @b{use} TERMINATION_LITERAL;

@end smallexample

@itemize @bullet

@item When a partition is configured with the global termination policy,
it terminates as soon as the main boot server sends a signal to do so. The main
boot server checks periodically whether the application can terminate. When 
all partitions are ready to terminate, the main boot server sends to each
partition a termination request. The global termination policy is the
default policy.

@item The deferred termination policy is very similar to the global
termination. The only difference is that when a partition with a
deferred termination policy receives a termination request, it just
ignores it. This policy allows a partition to run forever without
preventing a set of partitions from terminating. This policy is not yet
implemented.

@item When a partition is configured with the local termination policy,
it terminates as soon as the classical Ada termination is detected by
the partition. It means that this partition does not wait for the
termination request of the main boot server.

@end itemize

In any case, when the boot partition dies (and when no alternate boot
partition can elected, see @ref{Architecture of GLADE PCS}), all the
partitions die, whatever their termination policy might be. Note first, that
a partition cannot execute without a boot partition. Second, when the user
wants to kill his non-distributed application, he kills the main
program. Enforcing the mechanism described above ensures that
killing the main partition automatically kills all the partitions, that
is to say the whole distributed application.

@node Partition Attribute Reconnection, Channel Declaration, Partition Attribute Termination, The Configuration Language
@subsection Partition Attribute Reconnection

When no RCI package is configured on a partition, such a partition can
be launched several times without any problem. When one or more RCI
packages are configured on a partition, such a partition cannot be
launched more than once. If this partition were to be launched repeatedly,
it would not be possible to decide which partition instance should execute
a remote procedure call.

When a partition crashes or is stopped, one may want to restart this
partition and possibly restore its state - with Shared_Passive
packages, for instance. In such a situation, the partition is already
known to other partitions and possibly marked as a dead
partition. Several policies can be selected:


@smallexample

RECONNECTION_LITTERAL ::= Reject_On_Restart  |
                          Fail_Until_Restart |
                          Wait_Until_Restart

REPRESENTATION_CLAUSE ::=
   @b{for} PARTITION_IDENTIFIER'Reconnection @b{use} RECONNECTION_LITTERAL;

@end smallexample

@itemize @bullet

@item When this partition is configured with the Reject_On_Restart
reconnection policy, the dead partition is kept dead and any attempt to
restart it fails. Any remote call to a subprogram located on this
partition results in a Communication_Error exception. The
Reject_On_Restart policy is the default policy.

@item When this partition is configured with the Fail_Until_Restart 
reconnection policy, the dead partition can be restarted. Any remote
call to a subprogram located on this partition results in an exception
Communication_Error as long as this partition has not been restarted. As
soon as the partition is restarted, remote calls to this partition are
executed normally.

@item When this partition is configured with the Wait_Until_Restart
reconnection policy, the dead partition partition can be restarted. Any
remote call to a subprogram located on this partition is suspended until
the partition is restarted. As soon as the partition is restarted,
remote calls to this partition are executed normally. The suspended
remote procedure calls to this partition are resumed.

@node Channel Declaration, Partition and Channel Attribute Filter, Partition Attribute Reconnection, The Configuration Language
@subsection Channel Declaration

The configuration language not only describes partitions, but also
the connections between them. Such a connection is called a
Channel and represents a bi-directional link between two partitions. 

@smallexample

CHANNEL_DECLARATION ::= 
   CHANNEL_IDENTIFIER : Channel
      [:= PARTITION_PEER];

PARTITION_PEER ::= (PARTITION_IDENTIFIER, PARTITION_IDENTIFIER);

@end smallexample

A partition peer is a pair of distinct partition
names. The list order is not important. Of course, the designated
partitions have to be declared prior to the channel itself.

@smallexample

A_Channel : Channel := (Partition_1, Partition_2);

@end smallexample

This gives the link between partitions @i{Partition_1} and
@i{Partition_2} the name @i{A_Channel}. It is not possible to declare
more than one channel between the same two partitions.

@node Partition and Channel Attribute Filter, Pragma Registration_Filter, Channel Declaration, The Configuration Language
@subsection Partition and Channel Attribute Filter

GLADE contains a transparent extensible filtering mechanism that allows the
user to define various data transformations to be performed on the arguments
and return values of remote calls. One possible application is to
compress all data before sending it and to decompress it on the receiving
partition.

With GLADE, it is no longer necessary for the application to take care
of such transformations. Instead, users can write their own data
transformations and hook them into GLADE so that they are automatically
and transparently applied depending on the configuration of the
distributed application.

By default, no filtering is performed by GLADE, even though the compression
filter is always available. The user can choose to configure his distributed
application to use this filter.

In order to define filtering, one must first declare the channels
between the partitions of an application. Once a channel is defined,
the data transformation that is to be applied on all data sent through
it can be specified:

@smallexample

A_Channel : Channel := (Partition_1, Partition_2);

@b{for} A_Channel'Filter @b{use} "ZIP";

@end smallexample

This specifies that all data sent over this channel should be
transformed by the filter named @i{ZIP}. (There must be a filter with
this name, implemented in the package @i{System.Garlic.Filters.Zip}.)

It may also be useful to specify that a partition use a certain filter
for all remote calls, regardless of the channel (i.e., regardless of the
partition that will receive the remote call). This can be specified using
the attribute 'Filter on a partition:

@smallexample

@b{for} Partition_1'Filter @b{use} "ZIP";

@end smallexample

or

@smallexample

@b{for} Partition'Filter @b{use} "ZIP";

@end smallexample

The latter sets the default filter for all partitions of the
application, the former only sets the default filter for the partition
@i{Partition_1}.  It is also possible to apply a default filter and to
override this default for specific channels:

@smallexample

My_Channel : Channel := (Partition_1, Partition_2);

@b{for} My_Channel'Filter  @b{use} "ZIP";
@b{for} Partition_1'Filter @b{use} "Some_Other_Filter";

@end smallexample

This makes @i{Partition_1} use @i{Some_Other_Filter} for all remote
calls except for any communication with @i{Partition_2}, where the
filter @i{ZIP} is applied.

@t{gnatdist} takes care of consistency checking of a filter definition. For
instance, multiple filter definitions for the same channel are not
allowed. Filtering is only active if specified explicitly in the
configuration file.

@subsection Pragma Registration_Filter

Some filtering algorithms require that some parameters be sent to
the receiver first to enable it to correctly de-filter the data. If this
is the case, it may be necessary to filter these parameters as well. For
such purposes, it is possible to install a global filter for all
partitions, which will then be used to filter the parameters of other
filters. This filter is called the registration filter. It can be set by
a pragma because a pragma applies to the configuration:

@end smallexample

@node Pragma Version, Partition Attribute Task_Pool, Pragma Registration_Filter, The Configuration Language

A library unit is consistent if the same version of its declaration is

@end smallexample

@node Partition Attribute Task_Pool, A Complete Example, Pragma Version, The Configuration Language
@subsection Partition Attribute Task_Pool

When multiple remote subprogram calls occur on the same partition, they
are handled by several anonymous tasks. These tasks can be allocated
dynamically or re-used from a pool of (preallocated) tasks. When a
remote subprogram call is completed, the anonymous task can be
deallocated or queued in a pool in order to be re-used for further
remote subprogram calls. The number of tasks in the anonymous tasks pool
can be configured by means of three independent parameters.

@itemize @bullet

@item The task pool minimum size indicates the number of anonymous tasks 
preallocated and always available in the GLADE PCS. Preallocating
anonymous tasks can be useful in real-time systems to prevent task
dynamic allocation.

@item The task pool high size is a ceiling. When a remote subprogram
call is completed, its anonymous task is deallocated if the number of
tasks already in the pool is greater than the ceiling. If not, then the
task is queued in the pool.

@item The task pool maximum size indicates the maximum number of anonymous
tasks in the GLADE PCS. In other words, it provides a way to limit the
number of remote calls in the PCS. When a RPC request is received, if
the number of active remote calls is greater than the task pool maximum
size, then the request is kept pending until an anonymous task completes
its own remote call and becomes available.

In order to have only one active remote call at a  time, the task pool

@node A Complete Example,  , Partition Attribute Task_Pool, The Configuration Language
@subsection A Complete Example

Almost every keyword and construct defined in the configuration language
has been used in the following sample configuration file.

@include myconfig.cfg.texi

@enumerate

@item @b{Line 01}
Typically, after having created the following configuration file the user
types:

@smallexample

gnatdist myconfig.cfg

@end smallexample

If the user wants to build only some partitions then he will list the
partitions to build on the @t{gnatdist} command line as follows:

@smallexample

gnatdist myconfig.cfg partition_2 partition_3

@end smallexample

The name of the file prefix must be the same as the name of the
configuration unit, in this example @t{myconfig.cfg}. The file suffix
must be @t{cfg}. For a given distributed application the user can have
as many different configuration files as desired.

@item @b{Line 04}
Partition 1 contains no RCI package. However, it will contain the main
procedure of the distributed application, called @i{Master_Procedure} in
this example. If the line @i{procedure Master_Procedure is in
Partition_1;} was missing, Partition 1 would be completely empty. This is
forbidden, because a partition has to contain at least one library unit.

@t{gnatdist} produces an executable with the name of @i{Master_Procedure}
which will start the various partitions on their host machines in the
background. The main partition is launched in foreground. Note that by
killing this main procedure the whole distributed application is terminated.

@item @b{Line 08}
Specify the host on which to run partition 2.

@item @b{Line 12}
Use the value returned by a program to figure out at execution time the
name of the host on which partition 3 should execute.  For instance,
execute the shell script @t{best-node} which takes the partition name as
parameter and returns a string giving the name of the machine on which
partition_3 should be launched.

@item @b{Line 14}
Partition 4 contains one RCI package RCI_B5 No host is specified for
this partition. The startup script will ask for it interactively when it
is executed.

@item @b{Line 16}
Specify the directory in which the executable of partition partition_1
will be stored.

@item @b{Line 17}
Specify the directory in which all the partition executables will be
stored (except partition_1, see @ref{Pragmas and Representation
Clauses}). Default is the current directory.

@item @b{Line 20}
Specify the partition main subprogram to use in a given partition.

@item @b{Line 22}
Specify a reconnection policy in case of a crash of Partition_3. Any attempt to
reconnect to Partition_3 when this partition is dead will be 
blocked until Partition_3 restarts. By default, any restart is
rejected (Reject_On_Restart). Another policy is to raise
Communication_Error on any reconnection attempt until Partition_3 has
been restarted.

@item @b{Line 23}
Specify additional arguments to pass on the command line when a given
partition is launched.

@item @b{Line 24}
Specify a termination mechanism for partition_4. The default is to
compute a global distributed termination. When Local_Termination is
specified a partition terminates as soon as local termination is
detected (standard Ada termination).

@item @b{Line 26}
Specify the kind of startup method the user wants. There are 3
possibilities: Shell, Ada and None. Specifying @i{Shell} builds a shell
script. All the partitions will be launched from a shell script.  If
@i{Ada} is chosen, then the main Ada procedure itself is used to launch
the various partitions. If method @i{None} is chosen, then no launch
method is used and the user must start each partition manually.

If no starter is given, then an Ada starter will be used.

In this example, Partition_2, Partitions_3 and Partition_4 will be
started from Partition_1 (ie from the Ada procedure Master_Procedure).

@item @b{Line 30}
Specify the use of a particular boot server. It is especially useful
when the default port used by the GLADE PCS (randomly computed during
GLADE installation) is already assigned.

@item @b{Line 32}
It is a bounded error to elaborate a partition of a distributed
program that contains a compilation unit that depends on a different
version of the declaration of an RCI library unit than the one included in
the partition to which the RCI library unit was assigned. When the
pragma Version is set to False, no consistency check is performed.

@item @b{Line 335}
Declare two channels. Other channels between partitions remain
unknown.

@item @b{Line 37}
Use transparent compression / decompression for the arguments and

@item @b{Line 38}
Use filter @i{My_Own_Filter} on any declared channel ie @i{Channel_1}
amd @i{Channel_2}. As @i{Channel_1} filter attribute is already
assigned, this applies only to @i{Channel_2}. This filter must be
implemented in a package @i{System.Garlic.Filters.My_Own_Filter}.

@item @b{Line 39}
For all data exchanged between partitions, use the filter @i{ZIP}. (I.e.
for both arriving remote calls as well as for calls made by a
partition.)

@item @b{Line 41}
@i{Some_Filter} will be used to exchange a filter's parameters between
two partitions. @i{Some_Filter} itself must be an algorithm that doesn't
need its own parameters to be filtered again. This filter must be
implemented in a package @i{System.Garlic.Filters.Some_Filter}.

@item @b{Line 43}
The configuration body is optional. The user may have fully described
his configuration in the declaration part.

@item @b{Line 44}

Most of the previous attributes and pragmas can be modified at
run-time. The user can redefine some of the configuration options by
defining shell environment variables or by passing arguments on the
command line of a partition executable. In general, for a given feature
(Aa_Bb_Cc), there is a corresponding environmnent variable (AA_BB_CC)
and a corresponding command line option (@code{--}aa_bb_cc).

The environment variable (AA_BB_CC) can be set to a value of the
expected type. When a partition is executed from such a shell, the value
assigned in the configuration file is replaced by the value of the
environment variable. If the user shell is @t{sh}, @t{bash} or @t{zsh},
type:

@smallexample

AA_BB_CC=<x>
export AA_BB_CC

@end smallexample

If the user shell is @t{csh} or @t{tcsh}, type:

@smallexample

setenv AA_BB_CC <x>

@end smallexample

where <x> is a value of the expected type.

When the partition is launched with a command line option
@code{--}aa_bb_cc <x>, the value assigned in the configuration file or
by the shell environment variable is replaced by <x>.

For some environment variables, the value of the environment variable may
be irrelevant. For some command line options, no extra argument is needed.
In the following, type None means that extra information is
not needed. The feature is activated as soon as the environment variable
exists or as soon as the option is passed on the command line.

The precedence order for specifying a run-time parameter is as follows:
first the the command line option, then the environment
variable and finally the configuration attribute or pragma.

@subsection Command Line Option --trace

GLADE has a facility for trace/replay-based debugging. If trace mode
is turned on, GLADE will record into a trace file all messages received by
a partition. The trace file can then be used to replay the
execution of the partition, in isolation.

To get a partition to generate a trace file, it has to be given the
command line argument @code{--}trace. This is most easily done by using
a command line option (see @ref{Partition Attribute Command_Line}) in
the configuration file to add @code{--}trace to the command lines of the
partitions whose executions are to be replayed. When the application has
been built, and started using the starter, as usual, 
the trace files will be generated. It is also possible to build the
distributed application with the None starter and then to include the
@code{--}trace argument on the command line.

As a default, the file name of the trace file is the name of the
partition's executable (i.e. the string returned by the standard
procedure Ada.Command_Line.Command_Name) with a suffix @t{.ptf}. @t{ptf}
stands for Partition Trace File. It contains all the incoming requests
delivered to the current partition. The file name can be changed with
the @code{--}trace_file <othername> command line argument.

Note that when a remote partition is launched with @t{rsh} under Unix,
GLADE invokes the executable's name of this partition with its absolute
path included. Therefore, when @code{--}trace is passed on the command
line, the partition trace file includes the absolute path as well. If a
file name with a relative path is passed on the command line following
the @code{--}trace_file argument, then the home user's directory is
concatenated to the @code{--}trace_file argument.

@node Command Line Option --replay,  , Command Line Option --trace, Partition Command Line Options
@subsection Command Line Option --replay

In order to replay a partition whose execution has been previously
traced, the command line argument @code{--}replay is required. In addition,
the special boot server location "replay://" has to be specified,
i.e. by using the @code{--}boot_server replay:// command line argument.

To replay a traced execution of partition whose executable is named
@t{part}, we start it with the command

@smallexample

% part [@code{--}nolaunch] [@code{--}slave] @code{--}replay @code{--}boot_server replay://

@end smallexample

possibly under the control of a debugger, such as gdb.

Since the exact contents of the messages received is recorded,
differences in input from external sources (such as standard input)
during replay will most likely give unexpected results. Also, replay of
applications whose behavior is inherently non-deterministic - for example if
they  use tasking - will be problematic.

N.B. It is important that the same executable is used for replay as
when the trace file was generated, otherwise strange behavior can be
expected.

@subsection Architecture of GLADE PCS

When a partition starts executing, one of the first elaboration steps
is a registration with the partition id server and with the RCI
name server. These two servers are located on a boot server.

The partition id server is used to allocate a unique partition id when
a new partition registers. The id server also replies to information queries 
from other partitions. This information includes the ip
address, the port on which the partition is waiting for requests and all
its configuration parameters (termination policy, reconnection policy,
filters, ...).

The RCI name server is used to register newly elaborated RCI
packages. This RCI package registration occurs once the partition has
been allocated a partition id. The partition registers its RCI and SP
packages with their names, their version ids and internal information.

As described previously, the boot server partition can be replicated on boot
mirrors, in order to prevent this
partition from being a single point of failure. A partition has always to
connect to a boot server or a boot mirror in order to get a minimal information
set on the other existing partitions.

The boot server is the first boot mirror of the system. A new partition
declared as a boot mirror joins the group of boot mirrors. The group of
boot mirrors operates as a token ring: any request from a new partition to
a boot mirror is sent on the ring through a token. A request can traverse the
ring once or twice before being approved by all the other boot
mirrors.

When the boot server dies, a new boot server is elected among the
remaining boot mirrors. A boot server is responsible for the global
termination detection. That is why a new boot server has to be elected.

@node Heterogeneous System, Allocating Partition Ids, Architecture of GLADE PCS, GLADE Internals
@subsection Heterogeneous System

The GNAT environment provides default stream attributes, except for non-remote
access types (see @ref{Transmitting Dynamic Structure} and
@ref{Marshalling and Unmarshalling Operations}). The implementation of
the default attributes of predefined types can be found in
@i{System.Stream_Attributes} (s-stratt.adb).

The GLADE implementation overloads the GNAT default marshalling and
unmarshalling subprograms with its own subprograms, which format data
according to a @i{XDR}-like protocol. Therefore, any GLADE application
will work in an heterogeous environment.

If the user wants to keep using the GNAT default attributes for
performance purposes, or to use another protocol to marshall and
unmarshall predefined types, he can replace @t{s-stratt.adb} by a more
appropriate implementation.

@node Allocating Partition Ids, Executing Concurrent Remote Calls, Heterogeneous System, GLADE Internals
@subsection Allocating Partition Ids

The Partition_ID is allocated dynamically, at run-time. Each partition
connects to a Partition ID Server which is located on the boot server
and asks for a free Partition_ID. The advantage of this approach is that
it supports easily client / server solution (client partitions may be
duplicated, they will obtain different Partition Ids). There is no need
to recompile or relink all the partitions when a new partition is added
to the system. The Partition_ID is not tight in any way to a specific
protocol or to a specific location.

@node Executing Concurrent Remote Calls, Priority Inheritance, Allocating Partition Ids, GLADE Internals
@subsection Executing Concurrent Remote Calls

When multiple remote subprogram calls occur on the same partition, they
are handled by several anonymous tasks. The number of tasks in the
anonymous tasks pool can be configured by three figures (see
@ref{Partition Attribute Task_Pool}). Therefore, the user may have to
synchronize global data in the Remote_Call_Interface or Remote_Types
unit to preserve concurrent access on data. If the user want to suppress
the multiple requests features, he can force the configuration of the
anonymous tasks pool to (0 | 1, 0 | 1, 1). That means that there will be
at most one anonymous task running at a time.

@node Priority Inheritance, Remote Call Abortion, Executing Concurrent Remote Calls, GLADE Internals
@subsection Priority Inheritance

It is compiler-dependent whether the caller priority is preserved during a remote
procedure call. In fact, it can be unsafe to rely on priorities,
because two partitions may
have different priority ranges and policies. Nevertheless, GLADE
preserves the caller priority. This priority is marshalled and
unmarshalled during the remote procedure call and the priority of the anonymous
task on the server is set to the caller priority. There is no way currently to
disable this feature.

@node Remote Call Abortion, User Filter Implementation, Priority Inheritance, GLADE Internals
@subsection Remote Call Abortion

When a remote procedure call is aborted, GLADE will abort the calling
task on the caller side. It will also try to abort the remote
anonymous task performing the remote call. This task will be aborted
without being requeued in the anonymous tasks pool.

@node User Filter Implementation,  , Remote Call Abortion, GLADE Internals
@subsection User Filter Implementation

As has been briefly mentioned above, a filter with a name "NAME" must be
implemented in a package called @i{System.Garlic.Filters.Name}. The user
may write his own filters, which must implement their filtering of data
in the primitive operations of a type derived from the type
@i{System.Garlic.Filters.Filter_Type}. His filter package must then
register an instance of his newly derived type with GLADE by calling
@i{System.Garlic.Filters.Register}. From that on, his filter is ready to
be used.

For more information on how to write filter packages see the
sample implementation of a ZIP filter in files @t{s-gafizi.ad[bs]} in the
distribution. The user might also want to look at the example in the
@t{Filtering} directory of the GLADE distribution.

@node Remote Shell Notes,  , GLADE Internals, Getting Started With GLADE
@section Remote Shell Notes

To start a partition, the main partition executes a remote shell -
except when the distributed application is built with a None
starter. Thus the user has to make sure that he is authorized to execute
a remote shell on the remote machine. In this case, a first step would
be to add into his $HOME/.rhosts file a line like : <remote-machine>
<user-name>

If he is not authorized at all, he can bypass this problem. All he has
to do is:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Open a session on each machine listed in his configuration file.

@item
If MAIN_PART is the partition that includes the main procedure and if
he wants to start MAIN_PART on host MAIN_HOST:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Choose a TCP port number PORT_NUM

@item
Then for each partition PART, start manually the corresponding
executable on the corresponding host as follows

@smallexample
% PART [--nolaunch] --boot_server tcp://MAIN_HOST:PORT_NUM
@end smallexample

The --nolaunch parameter must be included for the main partition, it
means that this partition is not in charge of launching others.

If he wants to kill the distributed application before it terminates,
kill MAIN_PART.

@node CORBA Architecture, Interface Definition Language, DSA and CORBA, DSA and CORBA
@section CORBA Architecture

CORBA is an industry-sponsored effort to standardize the distributed
object paradigm via the CORBA Interface Definition Language (IDL).  The
use of IDL makes CORBA more self-describing than any other client/server
middleware. The Common Object Request Broker: Architecture and
Specification, revision 2.2 describes the main features of CORBA which
are Interface Definition Language, Language Mappings, Stubs, Skeletons
and Object Adapters, ORB, Interface Repository, Dynamic Invocation, ORB
protocols and CORBA services.

@image{corba-arch.fig}

The IDL specifies modules, constants, types and interfaces. An object
interface defines the operations, exceptions and public attributes a
client can invoke or access. CORBA offers a model based only on
distributed objects. In some respects, it can be compared to Java as
this language provides only an object-oriented programming model, and
discards the classical structured programming model.

An IDL translator generates client stubs and server skeletons in a host
language (@t{C++}, @t{C}, Java, Smalltalk, Ada95); a language mapping
specifies how IDL entities are implemented in the host
language. Depending on the features available in the host language, the
mapping can be more or less straightforward.  When an IDL feature is not
defined in the host language, the mapping provides a standardized but
complex way of simulating the missing feature.  Although the user works
with the generated code, a good understanding of the language mapping is
often necessary.

When the host language does not provide object-oriented features, the
user has to deal with a complex simulation of those functions. A @t{C++}
programmer has to follow several rules related to parameters passed by
reference. Defining whether the callee or the caller is responsible for
parameter memory allocation can be regarder as an issue of @t{C++} programming
conventions. The most difficult parts of the Ada mapping, which an Ada
programmer should avoid whenever possible, are multiple inheritance and
forward declarations.

The IDL translator produces several host language source files depending
on the language mapping: client files called stubs and server files
called skeletons. These files are specific to a vendor and product, as
they make calls to a proprietary communication subsystem, but their
structure and interface are supposed to follow a standard canvas.  The
client stubs convert user queries into requests to the ORB, which
transmits these requests through an object adapter to the server
skeleton.

@node Interface Definition Language, Network Communication Subsystem, CORBA Architecture, DSA and CORBA
@section Interface Definition Language

In DSA, the IDL is a subset of Ada95. The user identifies interface packages 
at compile time. Some library-level packages are categorized
using pragmas and these interface packages have to be library units.

In CORBA, the IDL is a description language; it supports @t{C++}
syntax for constant, type and operation declarations. From IDL
descriptions, a translator can directly generate client header files
and server implementation skeletons.

An IDL file can start by defining a module. This provides a name-space
to gather a set of interfaces. This is a way to introduce a level of
hierarchy (<@i{module}>::@-<@i{interface}>::@-<@i{operation}>). The Ada95
binding maps this element into a (child) package. @t{#include}
will make any other namespaces visible.

A module can define interfaces. An interface defines a set of methods
that a client can invoke on an object. An interface can also define
exceptions and attributes. An exception is like a @t{C++} exception: a
data component can be attached to it. An attribute is a component
field. For each @i{Attribute}, the implementation automatically creates
the subprograms Get_@i{Attribute} and Set_@i{Attribute}. Only Get is
provided for @i{readonly} attributes. An interface can derive from one
or more interfaces (multiple inheritance).

The Ada95 binding maps this element into a package or a child
package. For the client stub, the implementation will automatically
create a tagged type named Ref (which is derived from CORBA.Object.Ref
or from another Ref type defined in another interface) in a package
whose name matches the one of the interface. For the server skeleton,
the implementation will automatically create a tagged type named
Object (which is derived from an implementation defined private tagged
type Object) in a package named Impl, which is a child package of a
package named after the interface name (<@t{interface}>.Impl).

@include naming.idl.texi

A method is defined by a unique name (no overloading is allowed) and its
signature (the types of its formal parameters). Each parameter can be of
mode @b{in}, @b{out} or @b{inout}, whose meanings are comparable to
their Ada homonyms. Every exception that can be raised by a method must
also be declared as part of the method signature.

The @b{oneway} attribute can be applied to a subprogram, giving it
at-most-once semantics instead of the exactly-once default.
This precludes a method from having output parameters, a return
value, or from raising an exception. It is not portable to assume that the
caller resumes its execution once the input parameters are transmitted.

Most CORBA data types map in a straightforward way onto predefined Ada
types, with the exception of @t{any} and @t{sequence}.  @t{any}, that
can designate any CORBA type, is mapped onto a stream type with @t{read}
and @t{write} operations. A @t{sequence} holds a list of items of a
given type and is represented in Ada using a pair of lengthy generic
packages. One may note that the CORBA @t{string} type is mapped onto the
@t{Unbounded_String} Ada95 type. The IDL does not provide an equivalent
to unconstrained arrays.

The Ada95 mapping provides special mechanisms to implement two
difficult-to-map CORBA features. First, it provides a translation of
multiple inheritance. As described above, an Ada95 package defines a
type derived from the first interface, and extends the list of its
primitive operations to achieve inheritance from other
interfaces. Another unnatural feature of CORBA for an Ada programmer
comes from forward declarations. In Ada, two package specifications
cannot ``with'' each others, but this can occur between two IDL
interfaces.  To solve this, the mapping can create ``forward''
packages.  This can result in a very non-intuitive situation where the
client stub does not ``with'' its usual interface packages but
withs ``forward'' packages instead.

When developping a distributed application with CORBA, two situations
can arise. On the server side, the programmer is responsible for the
IDL file. He has to understand the Ada95 language mapping in order to
avoid structures with a non-trivial implementation whenever possible,
such as forward declaration and multiple inheritance. On both the server
and the client side, the programmer has to deal with the generated
code. A good understanding of the mapping is useful to get back and
forth from the IDL file to the generated code in order to keep an
overview of the distributed application. Understanding this mapping can
be a tedious task depending of the host language.

IDL interface information can be stored on-line in a database called
Interface Repository (IR). A CORBA specification describes how the
interface repository is organized and how to retrieve information from
it.  The reader will note that this information is close to what the Ada
Semantic Interface Specification (ASIS) can provide.

The interface repository allows a client to discover the signature of a
method which it did not know at compile time. It can subsequently use
this knowledge together with values for the method's parameters to
construct a complete request and invoke the method. The set of functions
that permits the construction of a method invocation request at run time
is the Dynamic Invocation Interface (DII).

The IR API allows the client to explore the repository classes to obtain
a module definition tree. From this tree, the client extracts subtrees
defining constants, types, exceptions, and interfaces. From an interface
subtree, the client can select an operation with its list of parameters
(type, name and mode) and exceptions.

A client has then three ways to make a request. As in the static case,
he can send it and wait for the result; he can also do a one-way call
and discard the result. With dynamic requests, a third mechanism is
offered: the client can send the request without waiting for the result,
and obtain it later, asynchronously.

The DII has a server-side counterpart, called Dynamic Skeleton
Interface (DSI). Both mechanisms are powerful but very complex and tedious to
use. In some respects, they also violate the Ada95 philosophy, because
strong typing is not preserved.  Most users will keep working with
static invocations.

@node Network Communication Subsystem, Distributed Application Development, Interface Definition Language, DSA and CORBA
@section Network Communication Subsystem

The communication subsystem is one of the key points of a
distributed system: it offers basic services such as the capability to
transmit a message from one part of the distributed program to
another. Those elementary services are then used by higher level
services to build a fully functional distributed system.

The limit between what belongs to the communication subsystem and what
belongs to an external service may sometimes be difficult to draw.
Moreover, something considered as a service in CORBA may be viewed as
purely internal in DSA.

@end menu

@node DSA PCS, CORBA ORB, Network Communication Subsystem, Network Communication Subsystem
@subsection DSA PCS

In the DSA world, everything that is not done by the compiler in
regard to the distribution belongs to the partition communication
subsystem (PCS). For example, figuring out on which partition a package
that will be called remotely is located is part of the PCS's
responsibility.

The PCS entry points are well defined in DSA, and described in the
@t{System.RPC} package declaration.  By looking at this package,
one can notice that there is nothing related to abortion of remote
subprogram calls, although the Annex states that if such a call is
aborted, an abortion message must be sent to the remote partition to
cancel remote processing. That means that the PCS is in charge of
detecting that a call to one of its entry points has been aborted and
must send such an abortion message, without any help from the
compiler.

Another interesting characteristic of the PCS is its behavior regarding
unknown exceptions. When an exception is raised as a result of the
execution of a remote subprogram call, it is propagated back to the
caller. However, the caller may not have any visibility over the
exception declaration, but may still catch it with a @t{when
others} clause. However, if the caller does not catch it and let it be
propagated upstream (maybe in another partition), and if the upstream
caller has visibility over this exception, it must be able to catch it
using its name. That means that the PCS must recognize that a
previously unknown exception maps onto a locally known one, for
example by being able to dynamically register a new exception into the 
runtime.

@node CORBA ORB,  , DSA PCS, Network Communication Subsystem
@subsection CORBA ORB

In CORBA, a much more fragmented approach to communication services was adopted:
they are essentially defined externally.  For example, the naming
service (which maps object names to object references) is a
distributed object with a standard IDL interface.

While this approach seems more pure, it has performance drawbacks.
Being itself a distributed object, the naming service cannot be
optimized for the needs of a specific ORB. A special case is also
required in the ORB for it to be able to locate the naming service
itself (chicken and egg problem): in order to get a reference on a
distributed object (an IOR, Interface Object Reference) to start with,
the programmer needs to have an IOR for the naming service.  This IOR
can be retrieved from the command line, from a file or by invoking the
ORB Interface, depending on the CORBA version.

Regarding exception propagation, an ORB is not able to propagate an
exception that has not been declared in the IDL interface. This
restriction, although annoying because it restricts the usage of
exceptions, is understandable given the multi-language CORBA approach:
what should be done, for example, when a @t{C++} exception reaches a
caller written in Ada? Note that an implementation may provide more
information in the CORBA exception message, such as the @t{C++} or Ada
exception name.

The DSA does not describe how a distributed application should be
configured. It is up to the user (using a partitioning tool whose
specification is outside the scope of the annex) to define what the
partitions in his program are and on which machines they should be
executed.

GLADE provides a Configuration Tool and a Partition Communication
Subsystem to build a distributed application. The @t{gnatdist} tool and
its configuration language have been specially designed to let the user
partition his program and specify the machines where the individual
partitions will be executing. The Generic Ada Reusable Library for
Interpartition Communication (GARLIC) is a high level communication
library that implements the interface between the Partition
Communication Subsystem defined in the Reference Manual and the network
communication layer with object-oriented techniques.

@node CORBA Application Development,  , DSA Application Development, Distributed Application Development
@subsection CORBA Application Development

The ORB provides a core of basic services. All other services are
provided by objects with IDL. The OMG has standardized a set of useful
services like Naming, Trading, Events, Licensing, Life Cycle, Events,
... A CORBA vendor is free to provide an implementation of these
services.

The Naming Service allows the association (@i{binding}) of an object
reference with user-friendly names. A name binding is always defined
relative to a @i{naming context} wherein it is unique. A naming context
is an object itself, and so can be bound to a name in another naming
context. One thus creates a @i{naming graph}, a directed graph with
naming contexts as vertices and names as edge labels. Given a context in
a naming graph, a sequence of names can thus reference an object. This
is very similar to the naming hierarchies that exist in the Domain Name
System and the UNIX file system. A typical scenario to start working
with the Name Service consists in providing a well-known remote
reference that defines the root of a naming and naming context
hierarchy. Then, many naming operations can be executed on this
hierarchy. The Trading Service provides a higher level of abstraction
than the Naming Service. If the Naming Service can be compared to the
White Pages, the Trading Service can be compared to the Yellow Pages.

The Events service provides a way for servers and clients to interact
through asynchronous events between anonymous objects. A @i{supplier}
produces events when a @i{consumer} receives notification and data. An
@i{event channel} is the mediator between consumers and
suppliers. @i{consumer admins} and @i{supplier admins} are in charge of
providing @i{proxies} to allow consumers and suppliers to get access to
the event channel. Suppliers and consumers produce and receive events
through their associated proxies. From the event channel point of view,
a @i{proxy supplier} (or @i{proxy consumer}) is seen as a consumer (or a
supplier).  Therefore, a proxy supplier (or proxy consumer) is an
extended interface of consumer (or supplier). The Events service defines
@i{push} and @i{pull} methods to exchange events. This allows to
define four models to exchange events and data.

@node Some Elements of Comparison,  , Distributed Application Development, DSA and CORBA
@section Some Elements of Comparison

CORBA provides an outstanding and very popular framework. The IDL syntax
is close to @t{C++}. The object model is close to Java: CORBA defines
only distributed objects. Furthermore, when using the Ada mapping, the
stub and skeleton generated code is close to Java with two root classes,
Ref for clients and Object for servers.

DSA provides a more general model. This includes distributed objects,
but also regular remote subprograms and references to remote
subprograms. Shared passive packages can be defined as an abstraction
for a (distributed) shared memory, a persistency support or a database.
Basically, the IDL is a subset of Ada95 and the remote services are
defined in packages categorized by three kinds of pragmas (RCI, RT,
SP). The distributed boundaries are more transparent as the application
is not split into IDL and host language sources.

In DSA, any Ada type can be used except access types, but this can be
solved by providing the marshalling operations for such a type. The
exception model is entirely preserved. Overloading is allowed in DSA
(not in CORBA). The user can also define generic packages and use mixin
mechanism to obtain some kind of multiple inheritance.

The DSA user can design, implement and test his application in a
non-distributed environment, and then switch to a distributed situation.
With this two-phase design approach, the user always works within his
favorite Ada95 environment. The use of pragma All_Calls_Remote also
facilitates debugging of a distributed application in a non-distributed
context.

To work on client stubs or server skeletons, the CORBA user will have to
deal with generated code. In any case, understanding the host language
mapping is always very useful. It can be required for some languages
like @t{C++}. An Ada programmer should avoid using forward declaration
or multiple inheritance (and in some respects, sequence).

The CORBA user has to re-adapt his code to the code generated by the
translator from the IDL file anytime the latter is modified. He also has
to use the predefined CORBA types instead of Ada standard types; he has
to call ORB functions or a naming service to obtain remote object
references.

As Ada95 is its own IDL, the user does not deal with any generated stub
or skeleton code. The configuration environment takes care of updating
object, stub and skeleton files when sources have been updated. The
system automatically provides some naming functions like declaring RCI
services. It also takes care of aborting remote procedure calls,
detecting distributed termination, checking version consistency between
clients and servers, and preserving and propagating any remote
exception. Note that none of these features are immediatly available in
CORBA.

The RM does not require a DSA implementation to work on heterogeneous
systems but GLADE, like any reasonable implementation, provides default
XDR-like marshalling operations. This feature can be inhibited for
performance reasons. An ORB is required to implement a Common Data
Representation (CDR) to ensure safe communications between heterogeneous
systems.

CORBA is a very rich but very complex standard. Its drawbacks include
the high learning curve for developing and managing CORBA applications
effectively, performance limitations, as well as the lack of portability
and security. These drawbacks are the price to pay for language
interoperability, a facility the Ada95-oriented DSA does not provide.

Interoperability between compilers is not yet an issue with DSA because
there is only one implementation available (GLADE). But it is a
validation requirement to permit the user to replace his current PCS with
a third-party PCS. We can note this issue was not resolved in CORBA
until revision 2.2. For the same reasons, we can expect future DSA
implementations to ensure PCS compatibility.

Using its IDL, the OMG has described a number of @t{Common Object
  Services} (COS) that are frequently needed in distributed
systems. Unfortunately, these specifications are limited to IDL
descriptions, and most of the semantics are up to the vendor. The DSA
misses such user-level libraries, including basic distributed software
components.  More generally, the lack of component libraries has always
been a problem for Ada.

Implementing CORBA services as native Ada95 distributed objects, taking
advantage of the standard language features, yields a simpler, easy to
understand and use specification. We have already implemented the Naming
service, the Events service and a service close to the Concurrency one
with DSA. Developping the CORBA services was an interesting experience.
We realized that although those services are nicely specified by an IDL
file, their semantics is quite vague in such a way portability is
dramatically broken. This work will be described in a future paper.

Another major goal of the GLADE team is to export DSA services to the
CORBA world.

The idea is to translate all DSA features to equivalent IDL features
using ASIS. This would allow the DSA user to connect his DSA server to an
ORB. This would also allow applications written in other languages to
invoke DSA features. We are also seeking to use this approach to offer a
DII mechanism for DSA.
