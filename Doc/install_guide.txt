Source Organization
-------------------

The GLADE distribution contains different components organized
in separate directories:

  1. Garlic 
     A PCS (partition communication subsystem) which is a high level
     communication layer that provides several classical services
     available in a distributed system (partition id management, name
     services, distributed termination, ...) and that accommodates
     several network protocols and communication sub-systems.

  2. Dist
     A partitioning tool called "gnatdist" and its configuration
     language which allow you to divide your program into a number of
     independent partitions and specify the machines where the
     individual partitions are to execute on.

  3. Ada
     A subset of GNAT @gnat_version@ sources necessary to build GLADE.

  4. Examples
     A set of examples to demonstrate GLADE capacities. Each example
     is self-contained and can be built separately by running 'make'
     in the subdirectory.
 

Binary Installation
-------------------

Binaries will be installed under the prefix specified by --prefix in
the configuration step (by default /usr/local).
      ./configure --prefix=${TARGET}
      make install
will result in installing all GLADE components in the following
directories:

  ${TARGET}/bin               : the executables, gnatdist and xe-gcc
  ${TARGET}/lib/garlic        : Garlic object files
  ${TARGET}/libexec           : Gnatdist secondary executables

The directory ${TARGET} has to exist before you install the package.

Major Configuration options:
-----------------------------

  --enable-debug          Turn on debugging options
  --without-launching     Don't include launching facilities
  --with-protocols        Enumerate protocol list
  --with-platform=letter  Select another platform's specific files (cross)
  --with-extra-libs=libs  Add extra libraries when building a program
  --srcdir=path           Enable building with Vpaths
  --build=name            Define the build machine
  --host=name             Define the host machine
  --target=name           Define the target machine 
  --prefix=path           Define the installation prefix


Building GLADE with  a non standard GNAT distrib
------------------------------------------------

We do not guarantee that this release will work with any other version
than the official GNAT @gnat_version@ binary release.  However, if you
are using another version of GNAT and want to try, you must have
GNAT's sources around. Assuming that you do, you must directly link
(using "ln -s" for instance) the directory "ada" that you received in
this distribution to the directory containing the sources of your
current GNAT compiler. The files that are currently stored under "ada"
in this distribution become irrelevant.  If a file called
"sdefault.adb" is found in the "ada" subdirectory, it will be used
during the build process. If not, one will be generated automatically.
