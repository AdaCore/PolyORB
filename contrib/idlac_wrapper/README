idlac_wrapper script
--------------------

PolyORB's IDL to Ada compiler (called idlac) always overwrites
existing files with new generated files. This is acceptable for
PolyORB's examples and small programs. But for larger IDL files, this
implies hundreds of files will be overwritten and then
recompiled. This recompilation may take a long time.

This scripts is a wrapper around idlac. It runs idlac in a separate
directory, compare the generated files with existing ones and
overwrite only modified files. Thus, it reduces the compilation time.
