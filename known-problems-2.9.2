The following is a listing of known problems in release 2.9. Except where
specifically noted, all these problems have been corrected in the final
release of the 2.10 technology. This means they are corrected in release
2.10 and in any wavefront issued subsequent to the date specified (in
ISO format YYYY-MM-DD) in the status line. This can be used to determine
if a given wavefront has the fix identified in the entry.

KP-292-M603-008 Float marshalling error with endianness change

  Problem:    When a float is transported between hosts of different
              endiannesses, and full data validity checks are generated
              (configure switch --enable-debug=all), a spurious
              CONSTRAINT_ERROR may be raised for some specific values.

  Status:     This was fixed in 2.10 on 2013-06-03

  Workaround: Do not enable full data validity checks.
