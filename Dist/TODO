CLADS : Configuration Language for Ada Distributed System

* Directory hierarchy should take into account the configuration name.
  
* Env. variable like GCC_PREFIX for GNATDIST.

* Handle or not rule E.5 (21) (pragma ...).

* Get -j parameter from command line and use it

* Improve generation, compilation and link steps

* Define "plateforms" or groupe of partitions in the configuration language
     PLATEFORM_NAME:
     begin
        ...
     end PLATEFORM_NAME;
  and
     enable the generation of a list of partitions

* New attributes : binary, input, output, error, flags, arguments

* Variable : P1 := P1 & (.., ..);

* Don't start partition when they are permanent and allow this feature

* Enable security features

* Enable a list of protocols to be loaded in a partitionand provide the
  code to make the protocol choice

* Enable an invocation mechanism that is not centralized

* Replication features

Bugs to fix :

* Bug in SGI version : the time stamps seems to be wrongly interpreted
  so stubs are generated too many times.
