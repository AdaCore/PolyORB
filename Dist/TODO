CLADS : Configuration Language for Ada Distributed System

* Change the way a configuration node is set.

* Improve debugging messages.

* There are still '/' characters to suppress (non-Unix stuff).

* When marking ali, do not print multiple messages.

* Improve tree output.

* Improve error messages.

* Move standard configuration creation outside parser.

* Pragma Import should not accept None_Import (comes from Starter move into
  Import).

* Pragma Import generation should be changed (create a procedure with the 
  name of the CLADS unit and invoke the external function).

* Strip executables when not debugging.

* Remove script when configuration has been modified.

* Env. variable like GCC_PREFIX for GNATDIST.

* Handle or not rule E.5 (21) (pragma ...).

* Get -j parameter from command line and use it

* Define "plateforms" or groupe of partitions in the configuration language
     PLATEFORM_NAME:
     begin
        ...
     end PLATEFORM_NAME;
  and
     enable the generation of a list of partitions

* New attributes : binary, input, output, error, flags, arguments

* Variable : P1 := P1 & (.., ..);

* Don't start partition when they are permanent and allow this feature

* Enable a list of protocols to be loaded in a partitionand provide the
  code to make the protocol choice

* Enable an invocation mechanism that is not centralized

* Replication features
