	* parser.adb: Avoid to output twice an error message in
	P_Type_Spec and in P_Declarator.

	* lexer.adb: Improve error detection and fixed literal
	parsing. Fix few bugs (08D was incorrectly interpreted as
	formatted in octal).

	* errors.adb: Define '|' as a character to escape a
	meta-character. This character is not frequently used.

	* iac-cpp: read env. variable CPPEXEC to redirect command either
	to cpp or mico-cpp. Note that cpp (GNU CPP) removes all
	unnecessary blanks and makes iac to incorrectly locate errors.

	* lexer.adb, lexer.ads: Scan string literals but on minor errors
	like having a string which appears to be a wide string, do not
	produce token T_Error. Instead, produce token T_String with
	Token_Name or String_Literal_Value set to Incorrect_String. Same
	for characters.

	* parser.adb: produce a null node when an incorrect string is
	parsed in order not to analyze it later on.

	* values.adb: do not crash when dumping an empty string value.

	* analyze.adb: properly detect type mismatch for floats,
	characters, strings.
